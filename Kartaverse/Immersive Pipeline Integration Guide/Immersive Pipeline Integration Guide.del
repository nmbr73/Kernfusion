## About

Welcome to the Kartaverse

About

As a technical writer and pipeline TD in the visual effects sector, I am pleased to be able to share a new workflow guide. In time, I hope the learning content might be deemed an essential read for those interested in accelerating immersive media post-production workflows using Blackmagic Design's Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio software as the central hub-like toolset.

The free guide has over 512 pages of content that covers the primary steps required to get a working content creation pipeline established from scratch for artists working at a freelancer, or small boutique studio scale of operation.

I'll be the first to admit that the document is a long read but you will be rewarded with a wide range of insights into topics you've likely not explored in-depth before. Enjoy!

Special Thanks

Special thanks go out to BMD staff including Peter Chamberlain, Steve Roberts, Kerry de Boer, Stephanie Hueter, Daniel Koch, and Peter Loveday for their assistance over the many years I've worked on Resolve/Fusion based community projects. Without their kind and thoughtful help many projects including this guide would not have been possible for me to create.

## Overview

Overview

The pipeline integration guide is written with the goal of helping new visual effects teams get up-and-running with a BMD (Blackmagic Design) Resolve Studio v18 & Fusion Studio v18 centric pipeline from scratch.

Since this is a workflow automation focused document, it will also cover the WSL Reactor Package Manager, the installation and use of render managers, the installation and configuration of 3rd party DCC (digital content creation) tools from the perspective of a compositor's needs, an overview of common Windows/Linux/macOS command-line utilities, bare-metal Windows/Linux operating system reloads, OpenColorIO, OpenImageIO, and more.

The end audience for this guide is primarily artists who are considering adopting "The Kartaverse" pipeline tools into their workflows.

## Install Reactor Package Manager

Install Reactor Package Manager

If you already use Blackmagic Design's Resolve, Resolve Studio, or Fusion Studio software then the singular most important tool you can choose to install is likely the free [Reactor Package Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3067).

The Fusion community developed the Reactor software as a group effort to create a single-stop resource that hosts the largest collection of curated content for extending the capabilities of Resolve/Fusion. Reactor also includes a lot of content that was previously available only on the [VFXPedia](https://www.steakunderwater.com/VFXPedia/96.0.243.189/index4875.html?title=Main_Page) resource.

**YouTube \| Reactor is released - GET IT NOW!**

**YouTube \| Fusion Reactor now available for BMD DaVinci Resolve**

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEIFl6gp58Q>

[![[img/image316.png]]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEIFl6gp58Q)

So far the Reactor Package Manager has been installed over 190,000 times since 2018! Wow. 🎉

[![[img/image90.png]]](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/download/file.php?id=4862)

To start using Reactor, first you need to download the [Reactor-Installer.lua](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/download/file.php?id=4862) script to your computer.

![[img/image261.png]]

Start up a new Resolve (Free), Resolve Studio, or Fusion Studio session. Open the Console window. Then simply drag the installer script from your desktop into the Fusion Console tab to run it.

Note: If you are in the Fusion page or using Fusion Studio you can press the "Shift + 0" shortcut to display the Console window.

If for some reason the drag-and-drop approach to launching the Reactor installer fails to work... Alternatively, you can also copy/paste the text contents of the script into the Console text entry area.

![[img/image267.png]]

In the DaVinci Resolve Fusion page and in Fusion Studio you can also drag the script from your desktop into the Nodes view to run it.

When the Reactor Installer starts you are presented with the following dialog. If you want to go with the default settings you simply have to press the "Install and Launch" button.

![[img/image384.png]]

Custom Install Path Button

When installing Reactor you also have the option to choose a "Custom Install Path". This button allows you to select a custom location you would like to have the Reactor content installed to. This could be a location like your user account's home folder, or another hard drive on your system, or a mapped network drive mount point for shared usage of Reactor content.

You can change the installed Reactor location later on by modifying the Fusion "PathMap" preferences and pointing the "Reactor:" PathMap at a new folder path.

Reactor Installation Status

Reactor shows a progress bar while the installation process is underway.

![[img/image357.png]]

When the Reactor installation is complete an Explorer (Win), Finder (macOS), or Nautilus (Linux) folder browsing window is displayed. This shows you the location on-disk where new Reactor content is downloaded to. This folder in Fusion terms is called the "Reactor:" PathMap location.

## Essential Reactor Atom Packages

Essential Reactor Atom Packages

There are currently (as of 2022-11-08) a total of 356 atom packages in the Reactor Package Manager. This means there is likely something interesting for just about any type of Resolve/Fusion user's tastes.

If you are regularly creating visual effects in Fusion Studio then the following Reactor atom packages are likely something you would deem essential to maintain your productivity and sanity:

-   Attribute Spreadsheet (Batch node editing)

## Adding KartaVR via Reactor

Adding KartaVR via Reactor

In order to install KartaVR you need to have Resolve/Fusion and the Reactor Package Manager installed beforehand. To add the KartaVR packages to a new workstation, first start by launching the Reactor Package Manager window.

In Fusion Studio you can do this by opening the root-level "Reactor" menu, then select the "Open Reactor" menu item.

![[img/image172.png]]

In Resolve Studio you can do this by opening the root-level "Workspaces" menu, then navigating to the "Scripts \> Comp \> Reactor \> Open Reactor..." menu item.

![[img/image371.png]]

When the Reactor Package Manager window loads initially you will see a list of all the atom packages that are able to be installed using this user interface.

Note: The content that is listed in the Reactor window comes from the [Reactor GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/WeSuckLess/Reactor). If you have an outgoing firewall, or your country/company/ISP (internet service provider) has network filtering rules that block access to GitLab you will have to use another approach to install the Reactor content on your system.

In the Reactor window, double-click on the left side-bar category item labelled "Kartaverse" to expand this hierarchy.

![[img/image18.png]]

Then select the "Kartaverse \> KartaVR" sub-category on the left sidebar to shorten the amount of content displayed in the part of the Reactor window where atom packages are listed.

![[img/image311.png]]

Click on the package name "KartaVR" in the main part of the Reactor window, and then press the "Install" button.

A progress dialog is displayed that shows each of the files as they are downloaded from the Reactor GitLab repository via cURL and installed into the "Reactor:/Deploy/" PathMap location on your hard disk.

![[img/image41.png]]

Several "Install Script Confirmation" dialogs will be displayed during the Reactor installation process. The dialog is asking for your input.

You can press the "OK" button if you would like to set up several preferences automatically during the install of the Reactor "Bin" category content like the FFmpeg utility. Alternatively, you can press the "Cancel Installation" button and that specific "Install Script" item will be skipped.

![[img/image75.png]]

After the "KartaVR" content has been fully installed, we then need to click on the package name "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" to install it as well. This Reactor package adds the extra open-source utilities needed to efficiently use the KartaVR automation scripts.

The "KartaVR 3rd Party Libraries" atom package description in the Reactor window lists all of the open-source tools you can optionally choose to install.

![[img/image148.png]]

## Adding Vonk Ultra via Reactor

Adding Vonk Ultra via Reactor

Vonk Ultra provides a wide range of "data node" fuses that allow you to create efficient node graphs in Fusion that directly work with text, numbers, CSV spreadsheets, JSON, XML, YAML, and many other types of data using modifier nodes. More information about [Vonk Ultra can be read in the documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9WfdHlE1AZHdU6_ZQCB1I2nSa5I7TyHG2vKMi2I7v8/edit?usp=sharing).

After you have the Reactor Package Manager window open again, you have the option to select the "Kartaverse \> Vonk Ultra" category on the left sidebar.

To install Vonk Ultra, click on the package named "Vonk Ultra", and then press the "Install" button. This will automatically install each of the required Vonk sub-packages in a single step.

![[img/image121.png]]

Once the Reactor installation process is complete, please relaunch Resolve or Fusion standalone. This will cause Fusion to scan for and then load the new fuses we just installed. Scanning for new fuses is a process only done when Fusion first starts up.

## The Kartaverse Packages

The Kartaverse Packages

Kartaverse is an extensive open-source media production pipeline that integrates seamlessly with a broad range of post-production tools used in VFX, VP, XR, 360VR, fulldome, volumetric video, computer vision, and machine learning workflows.

The core technologies that are part of the Kartaverse v5 suite are namely:

-   KartaVR
-   KartaVP
-   KartaVision
-   KartaSonic
-   KartaLink
-   CompX
-   Vonk Ultra

These modules are based upon the culmination of many years of research & development.

Kartaverse is delivered via the web as free open-source software. It costs you nothing to download and use the Kartaverse tools for both personal and commercial usage. It even works fine with Resolve (Free) running as the host program. The main tool, KartaVR, is Apache 2.0 licensed. Several tools like Vonk Ultra are GPL v3 licensed.

## Kartaverse Project Assistance

Kartaverse Project Assistance

If you want to assist the Kartaverse effort, the best way to help is to provide access to camera original "raw" unprocessed footage from a wide range of digital cinema cameras, DSLR/mirrorless cameras, flagship multi-lens mobile phones, drones, 360VR camera rigs, structured light depth sensors, lightfield cameras, and LIDAR scanners with permissive licensing. Anything you can share helps greatly.

Having new, modern, example footage to work with helps the whole Kartaverse community as it pushes forward the ongoing development of new tools, techniques and workflows.

It is important, if possible, that the sample footage is shared with permissive license terms that would allow the media to be used under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This media usage policy allows new example project files to be created and shared broadly with the community for learning purposes.

If you have access to sample footage that you are willing to share and are the copyright holder, [please email me](mailto:andrew@andrewhazelden.com). Thanks!

## The Karta Development Journey

The Karta Development Journey

Many of the workflow ideas and features found in the Kartaverse suite started development in the following toolsets that I had the opportunity to collaborate on as either a developer, co-developer, software maintainer, or technical writer.

## Choosing Your Installation Packages

Choosing Your Installation Packages

The Kartaverse package installation approach is very flexible. Reactor makes it possible to do a minimal installation of only the KartaVR features you need. This is a good choice when getting started so you don't become overwhelmed by choice.

![[img/image143.png]]

If you are are an entry-level 360VR content creator, who is new to using KartaVR in Resolve/Fusion, then you might choose to only install the "[Reframe360Ultra](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=36688#p36688)" and "[WarpStitchUltra](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=41337#p41337)" packages using Reactor. This is a good entry point during your first few weeks of using the toolset. These specific Reactor packages make it possible to work efficiently with fisheye, 360VR, and 180VR media.

As you become more comfortable you could slowly add more Kartaverse tools as required.

Alternatively, if you want to install every possible component in the full Kartaverse suite, it requires the dedication of several hours to set up the entire toolchain to a full production-usage level. This time estimate includes installing Resolve/Fusion/Fusion Render Node, configuring the settings in a render manager for each of the render nodes, and customizing the program execution paths for each of the 3rd party integration bindings available in the toolset.

## Fusion Render Node Customization

Fusion Render Node Customization

It is important to customize the Fusion Render node program's PathMap settings if you would like your render farm to be able to access the same Reactor content that you have installed in Resolve/Fusion on your laptop/desktop/workstation. This is especially true after fuses are installed using the Reactor Package Manager.

If you rely on fuses, OFX plugins, or FusionSDK C++ compiled plugins, you need to pre-install the 3rd party addons on each render node in your render farm. If you send a Fusion composite to a render farm node that lacks a required plugin it will generate an error during the batch rendering process.

Something that can help reduce the pain of setting up and syncing Reactor content across a render farm is sharing the exact same Reactor content across a mapped SMB drive mount, or on a NFS shared mount point.

An extra step that can often be overlooked is the requirement to configure a custom "`LuaModules:`" PathMap entry in the Fusion Render Node app preferences to avoid Fusion Render Manager errors when batch rendering comps that use fuses like the Vonk data nodes or Cryptomatte.

Note: The example below shows the PathMaps used for locally installed Reactor content that was added to a Reactor default "AllData:" folder based install.

You can point the "`Reactor:`" PathMap at any folder path you need to as long as it is not a UNC path, and it doesn't have high-ASCII or Unicode multi-byte extended characters in the filepath.

Make sure to have a trailing slash on the final absolute filepath used to define the PathMap entry for your version of the "`From: Reactor:`'' and"`To: /Volumes/Some/Random/Pipeline/Folder/Path/Reactor/`" install location.

## Configuring Fusion Render Node PathMaps

Configuring Fusion Render Node PathMaps

1\. Open the Fusion Render Node program and select the "Preferences..." menu item.

![[img/image49__fix4.png]]

2\. Click on the "Global Settings \> Path Map" category on the left side of the Preferences window.

![[img/image269__fix2.png]]

3\. At the bottom of the window click on the "New" button to add a new entry to the "User" section of the "Path Map" view.

4\. Enter the following settings `From: LuaModules:` and `To: UserPaths:Modules/Lua`. Click the "Save" button to retain these settings.

5\. If you don't have Reactor Path Map entries added to Fusion Render Node already, then you might have to further customize the preferences to add values like:

Windows:

`From: Reactor:` and `To: C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Reactor\`

macOS:

`From: Reactor:` and **T**`o: /Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Reactor/`

Linux:

`From: Reactor:` and `To: /var/BlackmagicDesign/Fusion/Reactor/`

Also you would need to edit the pre-existing UserPaths PathMap entry:

`From: UserPaths:` and `To: UserData:;AllData:;Fusion:;Reactor:Deploy`

6\. Restart Fusion Render Manager to lock in these values.

Note: If the LuaModules PathMap entries were not added to Fusion Render Node's preferences, a typical error message in Fusion Render Node would look a bit like this:

    14/Apr/22 16:12:50: .../Fusion/Fuses/Vonk Ultra/Text/Create/vTextFromArray.fuse:5: module 'vjsonutils' not found:
    no field package.preload['vjsonutils']
    no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils.lua'
    no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils/init.lua'
    no file 'LuaModules:vjsonutils.so'

## Installing the BMD Resolve / Fusion Software

Installing the BMD Resolve / Fusion Software

Blackmagic Design's Resolve software is a powerful editing and color correction environment. Resolve is a mainstay at many high-end post-production facilities in the film & TV sector.

Blackmagic Design's Fusion Studio software is a node-based compositing environment that allows for the creation of high-quality visual effects shots. Fusion provides artists with a very capable 2.5D compositing environment, and supports the design of complex animated 2D/3D motion graphics with a high level of node-based proceduralism. Fusion also enables 360VR content creation, and more.

### Download Resolve/Fusion Studio from BMD's Website

Download Resolve/Fusion Studio from BMD's Website

If you want to install the absolutely latest release of Resolve or Fusion you should go directly to the BMD Support Center Website to access the installers:

<https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion>

![[img/image285.png]]

Alternatively, the Steak Underwater Fusion community forum has a concise list of all BMD [Resolve](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=38797#p38797)and [Fusion](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=26553#p26553) releases with download links.

### Resolve (Free)

Resolve (Free)

If you are looking for "Resolve (free)" it is listed in the BMD support center as simply "Resolve". Resolve (Free)'s software license terms allow for both personal and commercial use of the software at no cost.

### About Resolve and the Fusion Page

About Resolve and the Fusion Page

Blackmagic Design provides access to a version of the Fusion compositing environment as a custom page in the Resolve software called the "Fusion" page.

![[img/image228.png]]

The Fusion page environment allows video editors to create their own title templates in Fusion and use them on the Edit page. The Fusion page node-based environment makes it a quick job to perform basic visual effects compositing tasks inside a larger Resolve project.

The Fusion page availability in Resolve (Free) led to the retirement of the earlier Fusion (Free) Standalone product at Fusion v9. If you want access to a standalone version of Fusion that is only found in the Fusion Studio product.

The Fusion page adds a new analogy of a "MediaIn" and "MediaOut" node which interfaces with the Media Pool/Edit/Delivery pages, in addition to the traditional "Loader" and "Saver" nodes used in Fusion for working with image sequences like OpenEXR format media.

The primary limitation of the free version of Resolve is that it can export footage at up to 3840x2160px resolution. This resolution limit is enforced as a maximum of 3840 px on the horizontal axis, and a maximum of 2160px on the vertical axis. A variety of advanced features like optical flow support, HMD previewing, and several other Fusion nodes are held back until you upgrade to Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio.

All in all, most people can get quite far in their everyday workflows in Resolve (Free).

If you are a freelancer doing multi-pass compositing with 4K UHD resolution EXR footage you can be very productive using merely the Resolve (Free) Fusion page environment. This is an optimal configuration to use while you are quickly mastering new skills and learning what is possible with the toolset.

### Resolve Studio (Paid)

Resolve Studio (Paid)

![[img/image287.png]]

The paid version of Resolve is known as "Resolve Studio".

There is a separate installer for Resolve Studio that is available on the BMD Support Center website. This is a separate download from the previous free version of Resolve that you might already have installed while you were evaluating the software. The two Resolve installers place the files at the same location on your hard disk so only one of them can exist at a time.

The paid version, Resolve Studio, is activated using either: a Resolve Studio "activation card" license, or a hardware-based USB licensing dongle that holds a Resolve Studio or a Fusion Studio v7-18+ license.

### Fusion Studio Improvements over the Resolve (Free) Fusion page

Fusion Studio Improvements over the Resolve (Free) Fusion page

Fusion Studio provides a dedicated, full-screen, standalone environment for compositing without the overhead of having all of Resolve loaded into memory at the same time.

Fusion Studio also saves your project files into .comp format documents. The .comp file format holds plain text encoded Lua table data which is easier to manage and backup inside of a larger visual effects production pipeline.

The paid Fusion Studio product unlocks access to higher-resolution rendering support, provides improved GPU-based hardware acceleration options, unlocks FusionSDK compiled plugin support for running tools like Krokodove, and gives access to external command-line automation via FuScript/Lua/Python. The paid version also adds machine learning features, optical flow, z-depth/disparity generator tools, 360VR headset preview support in the Fusion page, stereo 3D tools, and more.

If you have Fusion Studio installed on your system you also have the ability to access and use the Fusion Render Node program which allows for a near unlimited number of render nodes to be run on the same LAN based subnet with no additional license costs from BMD. This feature can massively speed up your rendering productivity on projects that require faster turn around.

Fusion Studio Standalone has a built-in Render Manager feature that works well for freelance, and solo-artists who work primarily from a single workstation based GUI session in a home-office or small office environment. The Fusion Studio bundled Render Manager is accessed using the "File \> Render Manager" menu item or the "Control + M" hotkey.

![[img/image262.png]]

### Fusion Render Node

Fusion Render Node

The Fusion Render Node program is available if you have a Fusion Studio license active on your LAN based subnet. Fusion Render Node is provided as a separate installer bundled alongside the Fusion Studio download from the BMD Support Center website.

![[img/image93.png]]

When getting started, the Fusion Render Node program is typically controlled from inside a Fusion Studio based artist session using the "Fusion Render Manager".

The Fusion render node program can also be launched directly from the command-prompt with CLI arguments, or you can control the render node software from an external render manager program of your choice.

#### Command Line Usage

Command Line Usage

If you launch Fusion Render Node from a Terminal/Command-Prompt window with the "-h" help flag added to the end of the line, you will see a list of the full commands that are available for your use:

    "/Applications/Blackmagic Fusion 18 Render Node/Fusion Render Node.app/Contents/MacOS/Fusion Render Node" -h

    Fusion Render Node [<filename.comp> | <filename.dfq>] [/quiet] [/render [/frames <frameset>] [/start <frame>] [/end <frame>] [/step <step>] [/quit]] [/listen] [/join <host>] [/log <filename>] [/cleanlog] [/verbose] [/quietlicense] [/version] [/pri high|above|normal|below|idle] [/args [...]] [/execute <script string>]

When you render a Fusion .comp file via the command prompt, the program control can be managed 100% manually under human control using the following style of shell syntax:

    "/Applications/Blackmagic Fusion 18 Render Node/Fusion Render Node.app/Contents/MacOS/Fusion Render Node" "/Users/vfx/Documents/MyProject/MyProject.comp" -render -verbose -quit

If you need a quick way to grab the filepath for your .comp document in the Finder (macOS) environment, you can right-click on the file with the ALT/Option key held down on the keyboard. A contextual menu item appears with a "Copy as Pathname" menu item. This will place the full absolute file path to the document in your macOS copy/paste clipboard.

![[img/image236__fix2.png]]

On Windows 10/11 you have a similar feature that lets you right-click on a file, with the shift-key held down. A contextual menu item appears with a "Copy as Path" menu item.

![[img/image308__fix1.png]]

### External Render Manager Usage

External Render Manager Usage

If you have a team of artists who rely on Fusion Render Node, as part of a larger post-production workflow, you will likely experience productivity benefits from adopting a 3rd party render manager like the [Amazon AWS Thinkbox Deadline](https://aws.amazon.com/thinkbox-deadline/) or [Pixar Tractor](https://renderman.pixar.com/tractor) software.

Having an external render management tool, that was made by a 3rd party company, allows you to combine Fusion based comp rendering jobs alongside your existing 3D rendering workloads coming from a 3D department.

Using a render manager like Deadline makes it easy to control the order of operations for a group of tasks, called a "[job batch](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/blog/job-batches-a-guide)", when they are computed on a render farm. This is often called a linked "dependent task".

Having a dependent job submitted to Deadline, in a single step, reduces the amount of manual "render wrangling" a human operator has to do when supervising complex jobs running on a large farm.

The "Submit Fusion Job to Deadline" scripted tool is used to define the Fusion .comp file you would like to render, the frame range to render, how many frames should be rendered per-job task, the version of Fusion Render Node to use, and many other options.

### Getting Started With Nodes in Fusion

Getting Started With Nodes in Fusion

If you are getting started with Fusion it can be a bit scary using nodes for the first time.

#### Loading Imagery

Loading Imagery

![[img/image50__fix3.png]]

Imagery is imported into Fusion using Loader or MediaIn nodes.

Imagery is exported from Fusion using Saver or MediaOut nodes.

If your Fusion timeline is set to have a single frame range (the start frame and end frame values are the same) you will be rendering a still image with your Saver node. If your Fusion timeline has a start frame and end frame range with different values, you will be exporting an image sequence.

When you are rendering imagery with a Saver node, frame padding is defined in an image sequence filename by writing in a frame number like 0000 to to match the number of zero padded digits you want in the final image:

    C:\media\image_sequence.0000.exr

You can render an image to your operating system's temp folder using a Fusion feature called a "path map" which is a relative path that is used in place of the drive name:

    Temp:\image_sequence.0000.exr

There is a path map option "Comp:\\" that can be used to load imagery relative to the location of the current Fusion .comp compositing file. This makes it easy to move .comp projects between systems.

    Comp:\image.0000.exr

#### Making Node Connections

Making Node Connections

Nodes are connected in Fusion by dragging a line from a red "output" box shape on one node into a triangle shaped "input" on another node.

![[img/image12.png]]

If you want to connect a macro with multiple output "red" boxes like the "VerticalCross2CubicFaces" macro to your node graph, it helps if you hover your cursor over the red box shape so a tooltip will pop-up with the name of the specific output.

![[img/image205.png]]

To view the current output of a node, you need to drag the node from the flow view to a viewer window. This will update the viewer window with that node's output.

If you drag a node with the shift key held down you can completely disconnect it from a node graph.

You can break the connection of a node by hovering over the starting part or ending part of a connection line. When the line end part turns light blue you can drag it away from the connection point and the node will be disconnected.

![[img/image245.png]]

If you want to make a connection to a node that has multiple inputs, you can hold down the ALT/Option key on your keyboard as you drag a new connection line to the node shape. A handy popup will appear that lists each of the inputs by name.

![[img/image163.png]]

#### The Fusion Viewer Window

The Fusion Viewer Window

You can toggle to a single viewer or a double viewer window layout using the following icon at the top of the screen:

![[img/image139.png]]

This is the typical viewer window layout in Fusion where there are two viewer windows available at the top of the Fusion UI.

![[img/image202.png]]

When a node is selected in the "flow" area, you can load its imagery into a specific viewer window by clicking with the left mouse button and dragging that node icon into the viewer window.

Another way to load a node's imagery into a specific viewer window is by pressing the "1" key for the left viewer window, or the "2" key for the right viewer window. To clear the imagery out of both viewer windows press the backquote "tilde" key that is located just below the escape key on most keyboards.

#### Color and Viewer LUTs

Color and Viewer LUTs

![[img/image115.png]]

You can access individual color channels in the viewer window's toolbar with the color channel menu, or by clicking in the viewer window and pressing the hotkeys **C** (Shows the Color RGB Channels), **R** (Shows the Red Channel), **G** (Shows the Green Channel), B (Shows the Blue Channel), or **A** (Shows the Alpha Channel).

If you are working with EXR format multi-channel imagery that includes extra image channels, more entries will be displayed in the color channel menus for items like Z-Depth, Disparity X/Y, Motion Vectors, etc.

![[img/image161.png]]

The LUT button allows you to change the viewer windows' preview LUT (Look Up Table) which means you can preview the effect of different color spaces on your imagery. This is useful for viewing RAW, sRGB, or Linear gamma based imagery. If your imagery looks washed out when loaded in Fusion it is typically due to a LUT setting mismatch.

![[img/image321.png]]

If you need to preview imagery in a color space other than the footage's native format, I recommend you try out the OpenColorIO based LUT menu option called OCIO ColorSpace ViewLUT as it is one of the easiest to use.

When the OCIO ColorSpace LUT is active, you can select the Edit... option in the LUT menu and change the OpenColorIO source space and output space to match your footage and monitor settings. This is handy for previewing LWF linear workflow based EXRs imagery in a monitor native sRGB format.

As a tip, you can type a Color Gamma value of 2.2 into the OCIO ColorSpace LUT window to perform a "live" on the fly linear workflow gamma 1.0 to sRGB gamma 2.2 conversion that will be displayed only in the Viewer window but the linear color values in the final rendered imagery with be unaffected.

#### Viewer Zoom

Viewer Zoom

![[img/image203.png]]

If an image is too large to easily be seen in the viewer window, you can press the "FIT" icon in the viewer window to scale the imagery to the size of the viewer window. The hotkey for fitting the image to the viewer window is Control + F (Win/Linux) or Command + F (macOS).

You can adjust the image zoom level in the viewer window with the menu that is located to the left of the fit icon. To jump to the 100% zoom level you can use the Control + 1 (Win/Linux) or Command + 1 (macOS) hotkey on your keyboard.

Holding down the Control key (Win/Linux) or Command key (macOS) and scrolling the mouse wheel also allows you to zoom in/out on the imagery in the viewer window.

#### Viewer Transparency

Viewer Transparency

![[img/image322.png]]

The viewer "•••" kebab menu (the menu entry with three dots) has a "Checker Underlay" option that is used to toggle on/off the transparent background checkerboard pattern in the viewer. This will allow you to either have a black background shown behind your transparent alpha channel image areas or a dark grey checker pattern.

#### Proxy Modes

Proxy Modes

There are two proxy mode buttons in the Fusion UI. The proxy buttons are labeled "Prx" and "APrx" and are located just below the timeline, to the right of the playback controls.

When you use the left mouse button to click on the "Prx" button you can toggle the proxy mode ON or OFF.

![[img/image389.png]]

When the proxy mode is enabled, the viewer windows are rendered at a reduced resolution compared to your final output setting. This makes Fusion's viewer windows more responsive and interactive which is quite noticeable when you start to adjust nodes and update the node settings on footage over 2K in resolution.

Using proxies as you develop a new comp is a very effective way to improve the rendering speed in your Viewer windows which is an essential workflow technique when working with high resolution media or on demanding composites that are slow to render.

![[img/image359.png]]

If you click on the "Prx" button with your right mouse button, a popup menu will appear that lets you adjust the level of the proxy resolution reduction that is used when the proxy mode is enabled.

Proxy level "1" will render the viewer window at full resolution. Setting the proxy level to a value higher than "1" will cause Fusion to reduce the quality of the imagery in the viewport by drastically reducing the render resolution. The proxy control has the ability to massively increase the speed that Fusion can update the imagery that is displayed in the viewer windows.

The "APrx" button is the Auto Proxy mode and it is used to provide a way to have a "draft quality" like proxy mode enabled. The APrx feature is activated the moment you start adjusting sliders and settings for a node, which allows you to have a real-time preview of the changes. When you stop adjusting the node settings, the auto proxy rendering state will deactivate and then your standard resolution / proxy settings will be used.

#### Adding Nodes Quickly

Adding Nodes Quickly

![[img/image173.png]]

When you are working in Fusion's flow area, you can press the Shift + Space hotkey to open up the Add Tool dialog. This window provides a quick way to add new tools and macros to your scene without having to navigate through the menu system to find the right item.

As you type in the name of the tool or macro you want to add, the list is updated with matching entries. You can type in partial names and the window will search for the closest item. In this example I typed in "Alpha" in the text field at the bottom of the dialog and only the nodes and macros with alpha in part of their name are listed.

![[img/image44.png]]

### Resolve/Fusion Scripting

Resolve/Fusion Scripting

Resolve Studio's scripting API and pipeline customization support has slowly improved since Python and Lua scripting were added in Resolve v15 back in 2018. The Resolve scripting API was originally added at the same time as the Fusion page was brought into Resolve since it was derived from Fusion Studio's pre-existing FuScript bindings.

#### Scripting Options

Scripting Options

Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio supports running scripts using Python 2.7 & 3.6-3.10+, as well as Lua scripting. There is a "[Python Script Snippets for Fusion TDs](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=11955#p11955)" Steakunderwater thread that collects useful Python compatible code snippets in one convenient place.

#### GUI Toolkits

GUI Toolkits

If you create a Resolve script using Python or Lua you have the option of using an integrated GUI creation toolkit called "UI Manager" which is based upon the QT window manager. If you require more complex GUI creation tools you can also bring along your own [PySide](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) install.

The Lua and Python scripting documentation for the Resolve API is located on-disk in the Developer folder. Additionally, there is a "Workflow Integrations" interface which adds NodeJS based scripting, too.

![[img/image255.png]]

Note: The "[README.txt](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=36549#p36549)" file in the Workflow Integrations folder also includes an aside that talks briefly about UI Manager. This readme document acts as the only official notes published by Blackmagic Design about the existence of the UI Manager GUI creation toolkit.

In part, this sparse documentation situation is due to the fact that the Fusion 8 Scripting Guide PDF was published prior to the addition of the UI Manager library in Resolve/Fusion.

This "README.txt" file is located on-disk at:

Windows Docs:

    C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\Workflow Integrations\README.txt

macOS Docs:

    /Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Workflow Integrations/README.txt

Linux Docs:

    Path to be validated.

#### Script Paths

Script Paths

User created Python and Lua scripts are placed on-disk in either of the two Resolve based "Scripts" folders:

    C:\Users\<User Account>\AppData\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\

    C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\

It is also possible to configure a relative filepath system called a "PathMap'' which allows you to use a custom folder path for storing scripts, macros, and other resources. This is customized in the"Fusion \> Fusion Settings..." menu. In the Fusion Settings window, look under the left sidebar entry labelled "PathMaps".

![[img/image61.png]]

#### Fusion Class Browser Script

Fusion Class Browser Script

There is a 3rd Party Scripting API browser tool distributed in the Reactor Package Manager called the "Fusion Class Browser" that is helpful for learning more about undocumented scripting API features.

This screenshot shows the results from examining the available Fairlight API functions using the Fusion Class Browser script.

![[img/image35.png]]

#### UI Manager Scripting Examples

UI Manager Scripting Examples

The Steakunderwater Fusion community forum's "[Building GUIs With Fusion's UI Manager](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=10463#p10463)" scripting thread provides example Lua and Python code to get you started.

There is a companion "*UI Manager Lua & Python Examples*" package in the Reactor Package Manager that simplifies the steps needed to download and install the collection of example script resources.

![[img/image344.png]]

#### ScriptLib Files

ScriptLib Files

Fusion has a .scriptlib file based-approach that can be used to run Lua code when a fresh Fusion session is started, or a new comp is created. Scriptlib files also allow the addition of new 3rd party Lua functions and global variables that are then available in all other Lua scripts you might run, and in fresh Fusion Console window sessions.

The Reactor Package Manager provides a "Resolve Essentials" atom package that improves the QoL (Quality of Life) for Resolve based scripting enthusiasts. This package also restores a missing scriptlib file that comes included with Fusion Studio but not with Resolve Studio.

This resource is copied into the scripts PathMap-based folder location of:

`Scripts:/bmd.scriptlib`

Which in Reactor terms equates to:

`Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/bmd.scriptlib`

#### Actions/Event Callbacks

Actions/Event Callbacks

Resolve's Fusion page has an action/event callback system that is implemented via .fu and .zfu files. These documents are placed in the "`Config:/`" PathMap folder.

A .fu file is a configuration document that is stored in a Lua table based text file. A .zfu file is a zip archive that holds a .fu file and any extra supporting resources like companion scripts or PNG formatted icons at the base level of the zip file with no encapsulating folders.

If a user-created action needs access to an on-disk resource, there is a "`$CFG/`" token value that can be entered as a prefix to a Lua script's file path entry. This `$CFG` token represents the parent folder where the .zfu/.fu file is located on-disk:

    Execute = [[target:RunScript("$CFG/SomeScript.lua", { mousex = args._sxpos, mousey = args._sypos })]],

A .fu file can be used to create new menus in Fusion Standalone, assign hotkeys to scripts and actions, and capture event hooks for many of the tasks a compositor carries out, as well as add drag-n-drop support for processing files dragged from a Desktop folder browsing window into the Nodes view.

The UI Manager example scripts include a minimal prototype of a QT-based Action/Event script listener tool called "Action Listener". This script can help you discover new and novel ways to automate your compositing workflows.

![[img/image80__fix3.png]]

#### GPU Accelerated Effects

GPU Accelerated Effects

The Edit/Color/Fusion pages all support the use of OFX plugins.

There is a customized version of the OFX plugin development documentation available in Resolve's Developer folder.

![[img/image145.png]]

Resolve also has a DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language) that is used to create LUTS. More information about DCTL is available in BMD's Docs. Also check out the [BaldAvenger GitHub repository](https://github.com/baldavenger/BaldavengerOFX) for code examples.

![[img/image27.png]]

The addition of the Fusion page in Resolve allowed for the inclusion of an "Effects Template" feature. These templates are installed using .setting and .drfx files which are based around Fusion macros that are packaged and used directly on clips in a video editing timeline.

This system allows for any Fusion node to be wrapped into a Group/Macro container object and exported for use in the Edit page.

![[img/image349.png]]

Custom GUI controls added to an Effects Template "macro" are accessible in the Inspector view on the Edit Page.

![[img/image33.png]]

You are able to refine an Edit page effect using the controls provided by the Fusion page. This is done by clicking the small magic-wand icon next to the macro's name in the Inspector window. The magic-wand icon has a small arrow pointing towards the base of the wand.

![[img/image232.png]]

Switching from the Edit page into the Fusion page in this fashion provides access to Fusion's traditional Spline and Keyframe editor views.

These animation editing controls in Fusion are more full-featured for adjusting keyframes and spline curve tangents than is possible with traditional ResolveFX/OFX Plugins that are animated on the Edit page.

![[img/image390.png]]

#### Fusion SDK

Fusion SDK

The Fusion page also has a Fusion SDK which is a C++ API. This development kit allows the creation of 2D Effects, 3D workspace based content, Renderer3D node based plugin rendering engines, the addition of new Loader/Saver node file formats, and more to be created.

The FusionSDK C++ files are available by request to developers at zero cost but require the signing of an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) with the BMD Developer program.

I'd suggest you try contacting BMD's support team about this topic, or if you happen to see Steve Roberts or Matt Jefferson at a BMD booth at a tradeshow event near you, make sure to ask them for more details while meeting them in-person.

#### Fuse SDK

Fuse SDK

The Fusion page has a Fuse API which allows DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language) based hardware accelerated graphics operations to be done inside a Lua scripted node that works seamlessly in a cross-platform way across Metal, OpenCL, and CUDA based GPUs.

The Fuse API also supports [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/luajit.html) based code to be used to do operations like render vector shapes, process image metadata, add custom image importer/exporter support, or apply effects. This Fuse API is the Fusion equivalent of Nuke Blink Scripting.

BMD released a new Fuse SDK PDF guide this year which is an excellent document for getting developers and enthusiasts comfortable with the Fuse API. The guide comes with Resolve/Fusion v18 now but it is also possible to download the guide from the BMD Software Support Center's "Latest Support Notes" category: [Fusion_Fuse_SDK.pdf](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/UserManuals/Fusion_Fuse_SDK.pdf?_v=1658361162000)

![[img/image189.png]]

#### Macros

Macros

A macro in the Fusion page is basically a grouped set of Fusion stock nodes that are collected inside a collapsible folder group.

When a macro is created using a grouped object it can have an internal registry-based node identifier type of either a "MacroOperator" or a "GroupOperator".

A macro is saved to disk as a plain text document that represents an ASCII-encoded Lua table structure on-disk. The macro file is saved with the file extension .setting.

When making macros to share with other users, it is important to know that a GroupOperator node can be easily re-expanded and edited later in the Nodes view.

A MacroOperator is harder to inspect as it needs you to copy the node into a programmer's plain text editor to revise its settings by hand.

When you have a MacroOperator open in a text editor, you can find & replace the word "MacroOperator" with "GroupOperator". This will allow you to visually expand that node's group in the Nodes view.

When creating macros, expressions can be added, along with intool scripts, and custom UserControl based GUIs. This allows for the construction of unique purpose built nodes that can work in both the Fusion and Edit pages.

There is an introductory "[Macro Building Essentials](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=11590#p11590)" thread on the Steakunderwater forum that helps artists create their own macros in only a short period of time.

![[img/image135.png]]

#### Building GUIs With Fusion's UI Manager

Building GUIs With Fusion's UI Manager

Resolve/Fusion supports the use of a native Lua and Python based GUI building system called the UI Manager library. This library is used whenever you need to create your own custom graphical user interface in a Fusion based Lua or Python script.

The UI Manager allows you to add object oriented windows, buttons, text fields, sliders, tree list views, and controls that are accessible inside your script code. The UI Manager library is QT window manager based, and it is designed to replace Fusion 7's older IUP and AskUser dialog approaches when creating script based GUIs.

##### Available GUI Elements

Available GUI Elements

As you start to construct new user interfaces in Resolve/Fusion, you can add the following GUI elements by placing them inside the window's `ui:VGroup{}` tag:

-   `ui:VGroup{}`
-   `ui:HGroup{}`
-   `ui:Stack{}`
-   ◦ `ui:VGap{}`
-   `ui:HGap{}`
-   `ui:Button{}`
-   `ui:CheckBox{}`
-   `ui:ColorPicker{}`
-   `ui:ComboBox{}`
-   `ui:DoubleSpinBox{}`
-   `ui:Label{}`
-   `ui:LineEdit{}`
-   `ui:Slider{}`
-   `ui:SpinBox{}`
-   `ui:TabBar{}`
-   `ui:TextEdit{}`
-   `ui:Tree{}`

##### What is an ID Tag?

What is an ID Tag?

In the UI Manager an important concept to understand at this point is that an ID tag string is placed inside the { } curly braces on every control in the GUI layout.

The ID tag setting could be just a single letter in quotes or it could be a longer text string (written without spaces) that is used to define the name that Lua uses to access that specific GUI element from code.

    ID = 'myCustomName',

ID tags are used to allow the UI Manager to respond uniquely to user interactions with each of the controls in a window such as handling button clicks, sliders, checkboxes, typing text in a textfield, etc...

##### AddWindow()

AddWindow()

The AddWindow() command is used to create a new UI Manager window. This window holds the GUI elements in a user interface.

![[img/image72__fix2.png]]

The following code snippet shows the bare minimum of code you need to add to a Lua script in order to create a new UI Manager based window that has a GUI element inside of it.

In this piece of sample code a new window is created that has the title "My First Window". The label GUI element is added to the view that displays the textual message "This is a Label". You can close the new view by clicking on the standard window close box.

    -- Create a new window
    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:Label{ ID = 'L', Text = 'This is a Label'},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()

##### How do I use the new GUI elements?

How do I use the new GUI elements?

###### ui:VGroup{} / ui:HGroup{}

ui:VGroup{} / ui:HGroup{}

The ui:VGroup{} and ui:HGroup{} GUI elements are used to create vertical and horizontal layouts inside the window. You can stack multiple of these group objects nested inside of each other to create complex GUIs with UI elements arranged onscreen in rows and columns, or even a grid style of layout is possible.

Lua:

    ui:VGroup{
      ID = "root",
      -- Add your GUI elements here:
    }.

Python:

    ui.VGroup({"ID": "root"},[
        # Add your GUI elements here:
    ]),

###### ui:VGap{} / ui:HGap{}

ui:VGap{} / ui:HGap{}

The ui:VGap{} and ui:HGap{} GUI elements are used to provide space between each of the GUI controls so it is easier to navigate inside the window and to create a more logical grouping of the elements inside of a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout. The gap controls have options that allow you to define the space between controls using either pixels or a relative measurement.

This example adds a 5 pixel wide horizontal gap between the controls that are placed on either side of a ui:HGap element in a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout:

Lua:

    ui:HGap(5),

Python:

    ui.HGap(5),

This example creates a flexible sized horizontal between the controls that are placed on either side of a ui:HGap element in a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layout:

Lua:

    ui:HGap(0, 1.0),

Python

    ui.HGap(0, 1.0),

###### ui:Button{}

ui:Button{}

The ui:Button{} control will create a simple rectangular shaped clickable button.

![[img/image306.png]]

You can assign a textual label to the new button by adding an attribute like: Text = 'The Button Label'. If your operating system's default font supports showing Emoji's or extended Unicode characters you can add them to the Text label string on a button, too.

If you want to add a button to a UI Manager window layout that is done by writing an entry like this:

    ui:Button{ID = "MyButton", Text = "Connect"},

The Text setting for the button is the actual label that is written on the button. You are able to use Unicode based Emoji icons as part of the Text label string if you are looking for an easy way to add a picture to the button.

The ID setting for the button is the internal name that is used to access the button from other functions in your Lua script.

After you have created a new ui:Button entry inside of your window creation code, further down in the Lua script you would add a matching function that responds to events that are triggered when the button is pressed.

Since I have an ID setting of MyButton I would need to create a Lua function like this to handle the button clicking action:

    function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
        print('Hello World!')
    end

Inside of the win.On.MyButton.Clicked() function you are free to write in any Lua code you want.

You can also rename the button's label once it has been clicked by assigning a new text string to the button label .Text attribute. The new string text that you can assign to the button label doesn't have to be a hard quoted object. It could be a string that is sourced at run-time from a dynamic element coming right from the active Fusion comp like the name of the active node selection, the current composite's filename, or it could come from any Lua variable you want to assign.

Changing a button label at runtime using Lua:

    function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
        itm.MyButton.Text = "Link Active"
    end

Adding a button using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:HGroup{
          Margin = 50,
          ui:Button{ID = 'MyButton', Text = 'The Button Label'},
        }
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    function win.On.MyButton.Clicked(ev)
      print('Button Clicked')
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

Adding a button using Python:

    ui = fu.UIManager
    disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

    dlg = disp.AddWindow({'WindowTitle': 'My First Window', 'ID': 'MyWin', 'Geometry': [100, 100, 200, 50], 'Spacing': 0,},[
        ui.VGroup({'Spacing': 0,},[
            # Add your GUI elements here:
            ui.HGroup({},[
                # Add four buttons that have an icon resource attached and no border shading
                ui.Button({
                    'ID': 'MyButton',
                    'Text': 'The Button Label',
                }),
            ]),
        ]),
    ])

    itm = dlg.GetItems()

    # The window was closed
    def _func(ev):
        disp.ExitLoop()
    dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

    # Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    def _func(ev):
        print('Button Clicked')
        disp.ExitLoop()
    dlg.On.MyButton.Clicked = _func

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:CheckBox{}

ui:CheckBox{}

The ui:CheckBox{} control will add a checkbox to the window layout. This control is used to define a [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) value which represents either a true (1) or false (0) logical state that corresponds visually to a checked or unchecked status for the control.

![[img/image290__fix1.png]]

You can assign a label to the new checkBox by adding an attribute like:

    Text = 'The Checkbox Label'.

Adding a Checkbox using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
        Margin = 50,
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:CheckBox{ID = 'MyCheckbox', Text = 'The Checkbox Label'},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    function win.On.MyCheckbox.Clicked(ev)
      print('[Checkbox] ' .. tostring(itm.MyCheckbox.Checked))
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

Adding a Checkbox using Python:

    ui = fu.UIManager
    disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

    dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 200],},[
        ui.VGroup({"Spacing": 0,},[
            # Add your GUI elements here:
            ui.CheckBox({"ID": "MyCheckbox", "Text": "The Checkbox Label"}),
        ]),
    ])

    itm = dlg.GetItems()

    # The window was closed
    def _func(ev):
        disp.ExitLoop()
    dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

    # Add your GUI element based event functions here:

    def _func(ev):
        print("[Checkbox] " + str(itm["MyCheckbox"].Checked))
    dlg.On.MyCheckbox.Clicked = _func

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:ColorPicker{}

ui:ColorPicker{}

The ui:ColorPicker{} control provides Red/Green/Blue color sliders and a preview color swatch that can be used to create a custom color value.

![[img/image81__fix2.png]]

You can enter a default color for the ColorPicker using:

    ui:ColorPicker{ ID = "Color", Color = { R = 0.753, G = 0.753, B = 0.753, A = 1}},

If you need an alpha channel slider in the ColorPicker then you can use:

    ui:ColorPicker{ ID = "Color", Color = { R = 1, G = 1, B = 1, A = 1}, DoAlpha = true  },

You can read the color picker RGB float values using:

    red = itm.Color.Color.R
    green = itm.Color.Color.G
    blue = itm.Color.Color.B

Adding a color picker using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:ColorPicker{ID = 'Color'},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

###### ui:ComboBox{}

ui:ComboBox{}

The ui:ComboBox{} control allows you to show a ComboControl / Options Menu style of menu that allows you to select an individual menu item from a list of entries.

![[img/image330__fix1.png]]

You can read the text string for the current ComboBox selection using ".CurrentText" like this:

    print(itm.MyCombo.CurrentText)

You can read the index value for the current ComboBox selection using ".CurrentIndex" like this:

    print(itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex)

Note: You need to define the list of menu items outside the AddWindow() function using the AddItem() command.

Adding a ComboBox using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,100
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:ComboBox{ID = 'MyCombo', Text = 'Combo Menu'},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    -- Add the items to the ComboBox menu
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Apple')
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Banana')
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Cherry')
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Orange')
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Mango')
    itm.MyCombo:AddItem('Kiwi')
     
    -- This function is run when a user picks a different setting in the ComboBox control
    function win.On.MyCombo.CurrentIndexChanged(ev)
      if itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 0 then
        -- Apple
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets make an apple crisp dessert.')
      elseif itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 1 then
        -- Banana
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets make a banana split with ice cream.')
      elseif itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 2 then
        -- Cherry
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets make some cherry tarts.')
      elseif itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 3 then
        -- Orange
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets peel an orange and have sliced orange boats.')
      elseif itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 4 then
        -- Mango
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets eat cubed mango chunks with yoghurt.')
      elseif itm.MyCombo.CurrentIndex == 5 then
        -- Kiwi
        print('[' .. itm.MyCombo.CurrentText .. '] Lets have a fresh Kiwi snack.')
      end
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:DoubleSpinBox{}

ui:DoubleSpinBox{}

The ui:DoubleSpinBox{} control allows you to enter numeric values. This GUI element can be incremented by typing a number in directly, pressing the up and down arrow buttons, or by clicking in the number field and then scrolling your mouse scroll wheel.

![[img/image153.png]]

You will typically want to control the size of the ui:DoubleSpinBox control in the GUI by placing it inside a ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} element.

Adding a DoubleSpinBox number field using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,75
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
     
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:DoubleSpinBox{ID='MySpinner'},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    function win.On.MySpinner.ValueChanged(ev)
      print('[DoubleSpinBox Value] '.. itm.MySpinner.Value)
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

Adding a DoubleSpinBox number field using Python:

    ui = fu.UIManager
    disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

    dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 280, 45], "Spacing": 10,},[
        ui.VGroup({"ID": "root"},[
            # Add your GUI elements here:
            ui.DoubleSpinBox({"ID": "MySpinner"}),
        ]),
    ])

    dlg.On.MySpinner.ValueChanged = _func

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:Label{}

ui:Label{}

The ui:Label{} control allows you to add a block of non user editable text to the window.

![[img/image263.png]]

Using several Label elements inside of your different ui:VGroup{} or ui:HGroup{} layouts can help visually break up a larger more complex window layout into smaller more logical groupings. This will make it easier for a user to understand what a set of controls can be used for.

Adding a textual label using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200

      Geometry = {100, 100, width, height},
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
     
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:Label{ID = 'L', Text = 'This is a Label', Alignment = { AlignHCenter = true, AlignTop = true },},
      },
    })

        ID = 'root',
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:Slider{ID = 'MySlider'},
       
        ui:Label{ID = 'MyLabel', Text = 'Value: ',},
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)

    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:LineEdit{}

ui:LineEdit{}

The ui:LineEdit{} control adds a single line based editable text field control.

![[img/image374.png]]

The "PlaceholderText" attribute lets you define a label text that is shown when the field is empty. This is useful for indicating what the control is meant to be used for.

Add a LineEdit field using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 400,200
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({

    function win.On.MyLineTxt.TextChanged(ev)
        print(itm.MyLineTxt.Text)
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

Add a LineEdit field using Python:

    ui = fu.UIManager
    disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

    dlg = disp.AddWindow({"WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 400, 125],},[
        ui.VGroup({"Spacing": 10,},[
            # Add your GUI elements here:
            ui.LineEdit({"ID": "MyLineTxt", "Text": "Hello Fusioneers!", "PlaceholderText": "Please Enter a few words.", "Weight": 0.5}),
            ui.Button({"ID": "PrintButton", "Text": "Print Text", "Weight": 0.5}),
        ]),
    ])

    itm = dlg.GetItems()

    # The window was closed
    def _func(ev):
        disp.ExitLoop()
    dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

    # Add your GUI element based event functions here:

    def _func(ev):
        print(itm['MyLineTxt'].Text)
    dlg.On.PrintButton.Clicked = _func

    def _func(ev):
        print(itm['MyLineTxt'].Text)
    dlg.On.MyLineTxt.TextChanged = _func

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:TextEdit{}

ui:TextEdit{}

The ui:TextEdit{} control adds an editable text field. It is possible to render the text field contents using either unformatted plaintext or HTML.

![[img/image271.png]]

A ui:TextEdit field's contents can be made read-only (and non-editable) by adding a "ReadOnly" tag like this:

    ui:TextEdit{ID='Txt', Text = 'Hello', ReadOnly = true,}

You can change the contents of a ui:TextEdit field using either:

    -- Plain unformatted text:
    itm.MyTxt.PlainText = 'Hello Fusioneers'

    -- HTML encoded text:
    itm.MyTxt.HTML = [[<h1>HTML Formatted Text</h1><p>This this HTML rendered in a ui:TextEdit field!</p>]]

The "PlaceholderText" attribute lets you define a label text that is shown when the field is empty. This is useful for indicating what the control is meant to be used for.

Add a TextEdit field using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 600,800
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'My First Window',
      Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
      Spacing = 10,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
        Margin = 50,
       
        -- Add your GUI elements here:
        ui:TextEdit{ID='MyTxt', Text = 'Hello', PlaceholderText = 'Please Enter a few words.',}
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    function win.On.MyTxt.TextChanged(ev)
        print(itm.MyTxt.PlainText)
    end
     
    win:Show()
    disp:RunLoop()
    win:Hide()

Add a TextEdit field using Python:

    ui = fu.UIManager
    disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)

    dlg = disp.AddWindow({ "WindowTitle": "My First Window", "ID": "MyWin", "Geometry": [100, 100, 600, 800], "Spacing": 10, "Margin": 10,},[
        ui.VGroup({ "ID": "root",},[
            # Add your GUI elements here:
            ui.TextEdit({ 
                "ID": "MyTxt",
                "Text": "Hello",
                "PlaceholderText": "Please Enter a few words.",
                "Lexer": "fusion",
            }),
        ]),
    ])

    itm = dlg.GetItems()

    # The window was closed
    def _func(ev):
        disp.ExitLoop()
    dlg.On.MyWin.Close = _func

    # Add your GUI element based event functions here:

    def _func(ev):
        print(itm['MyTxt'].PlainText)
    dlg.On.MyTxt.TextChanged = _func

    dlg.Show()
    disp.RunLoop()
    dlg.Hide()

###### ui:Tree{}

ui:Tree{}

The ui:Tree{} control creates a spreadsheet like grid layout. This is useful for listing elements in a report with rows and columns.

![[img/image328.png]]

The entries in a ui:Tree can be made clickable and sortable using the following tags:

    ui:Tree{ID = 'Tree', SortingEnabled=true, Events = {  ItemDoubleClicked=true, ItemClicked=true }, },

You can detect a single click on a row using "function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)".

You can detect a double click on a row using "function win.On.Tree.ItemDoubleClicked(ev)".

Inside the single click or double click events you can read the row name text that was clicked with "ev.item.Text\[1\]". The index value in the \[\] brackets is the specific column heading text you want to display.

You can edit the contents of a specific tree view cell that was clicked on using "ev.column" to access an individual cell:

    -- A Tree view cell was clicked on
    function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)
      -- You can use the ev.column value to edit a specific ui:Tree cell label
      ev.item.Text[ev.column] = '*CLICK*'
    end

It is possible to add folding disclosure triangle sections to a tree view to have sub-headings. This is a more advanced topic so it will be discussed in a future tutorial.

The width of each heading is adjusted using the ".ColumnWidth" setting:

    -- Resize the Columns
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[0] = 150
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[1] = 300
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[2] = 50

When you are dynamically re-building a tree view you can use the "itm.Tree:Clear()" command to clear out the existing items.

Add a tree view using Lua:

    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 430,700
     
    win = disp:AddWindow({
      ID = 'MyWin',
      WindowTitle = 'Tree',
      Geometry = { 100, 100, width, height },
      Spacing = 0,
     
      ui:VGroup{
        ID = 'root',
        ui:Tree{ID = 'Tree', SortingEnabled=true, Events = {ItemDoubleClicked=true, ItemClicked=true}, },  
      },
    })
     
    -- The window was closed
    function win.On.MyWin.Close(ev)
        disp:ExitLoop()
    end
     
    -- Add your GUI element based event functions here:
    itm = win:GetItems()
     
    -- Add a header row.
    hdr = itm.Tree:NewItem()
    hdr.Text[0] = ''
    hdr.Text[1] = 'Column A'
    hdr.Text[2] = 'Column B'
    hdr.Text[3] = 'Column C'
    hdr.Text[4] = 'Column D'
    hdr.Text[5] = 'Column E'
    itm.Tree:SetHeaderItem(hdr)
     
    -- Number of columns in the Tree list
    itm.Tree.ColumnCount = 5
     
    -- Resize the Columns
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[0] = 100
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[1] = 75
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[2] = 75
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[3] = 75
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[4] = 75
    itm.Tree.ColumnWidth[5] = 75
     
    -- Add an new row entries to the list
    for row = 1, 50 do
      itRow = itm.Tree:NewItem();
      -- String.format is used to create a leading zero padded row number like 'Row A01' or 'Row B01'.
      itRow.Text[0] = string.format('Row %02d', row);
      itRow.Text[1] = string.format('A %02d', row);
      itRow.Text[2] = string.format('B %02d', row);
      itRow.Text[3] = string.format('C %02d', row);
      itRow.Text[4] = string.format('D %02d', row);  
      itRow.Text[5] = string.format('E %02d', row);
      itm.Tree:AddTopLevelItem(itRow)
    end
     
    -- A Tree view row was clicked on
    function win.On.Tree.ItemClicked(ev)
      print('[Single Clicked] ' .. tostring(ev.item.Text[0]))
     
      -- You can use the ev.column value to edit a specific ui:Tree cell label
      ev.item.Text[ev.column] = '*CLICK*'
    end
     
    -- A Tree view row was double clicked on
    function win.On.Tree.ItemDoubleClicked(ev)
      print('[Double Clicked] ' .. tostring(ev.item.Text[0]))

##### AddConfig

AddConfig

AddConfig() is a function that is often used to capture window closing hotkeys events.

This approach stops Fusion from closing your foreground composite document each time a user presses Escape, Control+W/Command+W, or Control+F4/Command+F4 when the user expects the hotkey will be used to actually close a UI Manager GUI window instead.

AddConfig using Lua:

    -- Check the current operating system platform
    local platform = (FuPLATFORM_WINDOWS and 'Windows') or (FuPLATFORM_MAC and 'Mac') or (FuPLATFORM_LINUX and 'Linux')

    -- Create the appropriate hotkey message if you are on Windows/Linux or Mac
    local hotkeyTextMessage = 'Press (Control + W) or (Control + F4) to close this window.'
    if platform == 'Mac' then
        hotkeyTextMessage = 'Press (Command + W) or (Command + F4) to close this window.'
    end

    -- Create the UI Manager GUI
    local ui = fu.UIManager
    local disp = bmd.UIDispatcher(ui)
    local width,height = 900,132

    win = disp:AddWindow({
        ID = 'HotkeysWin',
        TargetID = 'HotkeysWin',
        WindowTitle = 'Dynamic Hotkeys',
        Geometry = {0, 100, width, height},
        Margin = 20,
        Spacing = 0,

        ui:HGroup{
            ID = 'root',
            -- Add your GUI elements here:

            ui:Label{
                ID = 'HotkeysLabel',

##### File and Folder Browsing Dialogs

File and Folder Browsing Dialogs

The RequestFile/RequestDir functions provide pre-made file browsing user interfaces for situations where you need to provide a "Browse" button that allows you to select files on-disk.

#### Using SlashFor to Batch Edit Nodes in a Comp

Using SlashFor to Batch Edit Nodes in a Comp

Normally a fuse is associated with creating visual imagery in Fusion's viewer window.

There is another type of fuse that is possible and it is called a "Console" fuse. This is a tool that is designed simply to process text and print out results back into the Console window.

In order to make it easier to build custom Python and Lua scripts that interface with Console fuses, a technology called a "SlashCommand" was created.

The SlashCommands that are installed via Reactor exist on-disk at the PathMap location of:

`Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/SlashCommand/`

When you type text into the Fusion Console window, with a leading slash character added, that line of text-based input is interpreted as a SlashCommand. This is used to launch a custom 3rd party Lua or Python script to parse the user input.

Note: It would be theoretically possible to create a fully interactive "MUD-like" text-adventure game interpreter with a SlashCommand based script.

SlashFor is by far the most significant SlashCommand fuse. It was created by WSL member tberakis in the following Reactor Submissions thread:

[WSL \| \[Submission\] /for console slash-command](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=14260#p14260)

![[img/image103.png]]

Here is an example of what the "SlashFor" tool returns in the Console when it is run without any parameters entered after the tool name:

![[img/image270.png]]

Usage Example:

    > /for
    Usage: /for (selected|visible|all) [tooltype[,tooltype...]] [where <condition>] <command> [ & <command>...]
    Supported commands:
        animate <input> [(with <modifier>|remove)] [force]
        color [tile <color>] [text <color>] [fill <color>]
        get <input> ([at <time>])
        getattrs <attribute>
        select [(add|remove)]
        set <input> ([at <time>] to <value>|expression <exp>)
        setattrs <attribute> (to <value>)
        setclip (to <value>)
        setname (to <value>)

#### Hypertext Compositor

Hypertext Compositor

[Hypertext Compositor is an Interactive Documentation & Walkthrough Tool for Compers](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=23827#p23827)

The "Hypertext Compositor" tool is available in Reactor and it can be used to create e-documentation and templated comp walkthroughs. It is accessible in the Reactor "Docs" category.

![[img/image158.png]]

The Hypertext Compositor script looks for an HTML formatted sidecar .htm webpage file in the same folder as a .comp file. This allows you to pass along an illustrated guide about the composite to other users.

Hypertext Compositor supports the use of custom Fusion comp based HTML "a href" anchor codes to create guided tutorials that can control the Fusion timeline, adjust comp settings, add nodes/macros/media/3D models, run scripts, and display content in the viewer window when you click on the hyperlinks. If you (Shift + Click) on a hyperlink a preview of the URL will be displayed.

In Resolve/Fusion you can also drag an .htm file from your desktop and drop it in the Nodes view and the webpage will be displayed in a new window.

Hypertext Compositor was inspired by an old-school Fusion term called "SBS" or Side-by-Side that was used to represent an approach where a Lua script could be run by Fusion as soon as a .comp file of the same name was opened. The Hypertext Compositor extends this Side-by-Side system to support comp specific documentation.

##### Hypertext Compositor Screenshots

Hypertext Compositor Screenshots

Here are two screenshots that show the Hypertext Compositor window active with a side-by-side webpage loaded. The clickable links are able to help guide the usage of the composite that is open.

![[img/image199.jpg]]

![[img/image192.png]]

##### Hypertext Compositor Usage

Hypertext Compositor Usage

If you had a composite called "wesuckless.comp", the SBS HTML formatted sidecar file would be named "wesuckless.htm". When the composite is opened using the "File \> Open..." or "File \> Open Recent \>" menu items, the matching HTML guide would be displayed automatically.

##### Hypertext Compositor Editor

Hypertext Compositor Editor

An HTML code editor is provided that makes it easy to live-edit and preview the .htm documentation with the images visible, and special clickable hyperlinks are active, too. At the top left of the Editor UI is a ComboBox menu that allows you to quickly add the commands to control a Fusion session.

![[img/image158.png]]

Images

The HTML Viewer supports PNG images. You can refer to the media using a PathMap based image embedding source URL. To display an image with a relative path starting at the same folder as your .comp/.htm file is located use:

    <img src="Comp:/example.png">

or you could make a "docs" subfolder in your comp directory using and display the image using:

    <img src="Comp:/docs/example.png">

## Working With Environment Variables

Working With Environment Variables

An environment variable can be thought of as a system wide preference that any program that is started is able to read. An environment variable is a technique that system administrators will often use to customize the operating environment that software runs inside of on a workstation or render node.

This concept of customizing environment variables allows you to pass a common set of preferences to multiple executable programs in a consistent way. It helps inform software of the custom values you might want to define system wide and avoids using hard-coded fixed settings in each application.

It is possible to read environment variables inside of just about every general purpose programming language or scripting language like C, C++, C#, Python, Lua, Perl, PHP, Batch, and BASH/ZSH, etc.

### Windows Environment Variables

Windows Environment Variables

The "PATH" variable, which is written as %PATH% when accessed from the command prompt window, is used for several purposes. One of those use cases is to define which executable programs on your computer (.exe, .bat, etc files) can be run from a terminal session simply by typing in the program's base filename without having to always write in the full folder path to the program.

This saves a lot of time when a user frequently navigates a filesystem hierarchy in a text based command prompt/terminal window and runs a series of command line tools.

Editing the Windows OS %PATH% environment variable is done by opening your Windows System Control Panel. Click on the Advanced system settings button on the left side of the window.

![[img/image231.png]]

The "System Properties" window will appear. Click on the Environment Variables... button.

![[img/image126.png]]

In the "Environment Variable" window you need to scroll down in the "System variables" section of the view and select the Path entry. Click the Edit... button.

![[img/image378.png]]

On Windows 10 a visual "Edit environment variable" editor window will appear. This dialog has separate path text fields that make it easier to add/remove and re-order the individual environment `%Path%` variable items.

![[img/image355.png]]

On Windows 10 you can type "`set`" into the Command Prompt window to see all of the active environment variables on the system.

![[img/image365.png]]

### Linux Environment Variables

Linux Environment Variables

If you are on a Linux system, system wide environment variables are typically defined by editing either a "`$HOME/.profile`" or "`$HOME/.bash_profile`" document based upon your current shell.

You would then add new environment variable to the profile document that look a bit like this:

    export REACTOR_DEBUG_FILES=true
    export REACTOR_DEBUG=true
    export REACTOR_INSTALL_PATHMAP=AllData:

#### Listing the Active Linux Environment Variables

On Linux you can type "`env`" into the Terminal window to see all of the active environment variables on the system.

### macOS Environment Variables

macOS Environment Variables

If you are on macOS Monterey, you might have several environment variables active in your macOS ZSH session, that were defined via a "`$HOME/.zshrc`" file. If you add more and more environment variables to your workstation in this fashion, you will later on be quite surprised to find out these values are not used system wide in all of the programs you might run.

In the long term, macOS power users tend to transition away from relying on .zshrc files as the way they define their environment variables over to using macOS Launch Agent .plist files. The .plist file approach is advantageous as it allows executables that are started by double-clicking on the .app package, or run from the dock, to access the same environment variables values that can be accessed in Terminal sessions and in AppleScripts, too.

On a macOS system the easiest and most reliable way to set up new environment variables is with the help of LaunchAgent .plist files. If you want to make it easy to visually edit a LaunchAgent PLIST document as you get started, you can look at using a 3rd party utility like["LaunchControl" by Soma-Zone](http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/).

Most often Launch Agent .plist files are edited by hand in a programmer's text editor, to customize them, before you would install them on your system.

Here is an example of a Launch Agent PLIST text file that ships with the Reactor package manager. It is named "setenv.reactor.REACTOR_DEBUG.plist" and is used to turn on debug logging via a "`REACTOR_DEBUG`" environment variable that is set to a value of "`true`":

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
         <key>Label</key>
         <string>setenv.reactor.REACTOR_DEBUG</string>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
         <array>
             <string>/bin/launchctl</string>
             <string>setenv</string>
             <string>REACTOR_DEBUG</string>
             <string>true</string>
         </array>
         <key>RunAtLoad</key>
         <true/>
        </dict>
    </plist>

These type of Launch Agent .plist documents are designed to be installed on your macOS system using root permissions to the folder:

    /Library/LaunchAgents/

Alternatively, you can install a Launch Agent .plist file in your home folder:

    /Users/vfx/Library/LaunchAgents

When you go to install the .plist files you will need to change the documents to be owned by "root", have the group name of "wheel", and have a Unix "octal" file permission setting of 644.

    sudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.reactor.*.plist
    sudo chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.reactor.*.plist
    sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.reactor.*.plist

You can take a look at the file permissions of the Launch Agent files on your system using the following terminal command:

    ls -la /Library/LaunchAgents/

You will then see a directory listing that looks something like this:

    drwxr-xr-x  24 root  wheel   816 Nov 17 12:28 .
    drwxr-xr-x+ 62 root  wheel  2108 Nov 17 11:59 ..
    -rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel   715 Oct 26  2016 org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist
    -rw-r--r--@  1 root  wheel   474 Nov 17 05:42 setenv.reactor.REACTOR_BRANCH.plist
    -rw-r--r--@  1 root  wheel   463 Oct 25 07:25 setenv.reactor.REACTOR_DEBUG.plist
    -rw-r--r--@  1 root  wheel   475 Oct 25 07:27 setenv.reactor.REACTOR_DEBUG_FILES.plist
    -rw-r--r--@  1 root  wheel   473 Dec  7 22:23 setenv.reactor.REACTOR_INSTALL_PATHMAP.plist

### Blocking Incompatible OFX Plugins From Loading in Fusion

Blocking Incompatible OFX Plugins From Loading in Fusion

After you install a wider range of compositing tools on your visual workstations and render nodes, you will likely need to set up a "Fusion OFX Blocklist File". This will stop a wide range of Fusion startup error messages from being spawned regularly by the broken OFX plugins, that would otherwise spam the Console window and halt Fusion with nagging error dialogs.

The standard OFX Plugin folder location is:

Windows:

    C:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX\Plugins

Mac:

    /Library/OFX/Plugins/

Linux:

    /usr/OFX/Plugins/

An interesting thing about using an OFX blocklist file approach, is that it allows incompatible OFX plugins to be skipped transparently when Fusion Studio/Fusion Render Nodes are launched. This is achieved by specifically defining the exact name of the OFX plugins you want excluded, one-item-per-line in the file.

This document is created at the PathMap location of:

    Profile:\FusionOFX.blocklist

The "UI Manager" atom package includes a handy script called the "OFX Blocklist Generator" that streamlines the effort needed to prepare a Fusion Studio v18 compatible blocklist resource. The script scans inside your OFX Plugins folder path and then lists those items in a new text-based configuration file.

### Fusion Profile Customizations

Fusion Profile Customizations

A customized Fusion Profile Path can be configured to pre-define the Fusion preferences for an artist through the use of environment variables, along with a Fusion Master Prefs.

Make sure to define a Master Prefs locking setting when generating the Lua table based document.

### Fusion Diagnostic Tool

Fusion Diagnostic Tool

The "UI Manager" atom package includes a handy script called the "Fusion Diagnostics Tool" that allows you to troubleshoot your most common Fusion-based environment variables in a low-effort fashion.

#### Deadline Plugins Patching

Deadline Plugins Patching

In order to get the most out of Amazon AWS Deadline software, you will likely need to edit a few of the submitters and configuration files by hand in a programmer's text editor like "Notepad++", "BBEdit", or "gedit". This step is relevant in cases where you are using the Deadline toolset in the license-free mode, and are working without a paid AWS Thinkbox support contract.

The "Submit Fusion Job To Deadline" scripted GUI looks like this image below. It has been modified to add newer Fusion Render Node version support than currently comes in a stock release of Deadline. Instructions below cover this process.

![[img/image363.png]]

We need to start by adding a revised set of "Fusion.ico" / "FusionCmd.ico" image resources to match our use of BMD Fusion Studio v18.

The following items listed below are listings of the individual text files you need to manually open up in your text editor. Also included are the sections of the text file you need to find in the document and then edit by hand.

## Pixar Tractor Deployment

Pixar Tractor Deployment

Pixar's Tractor render management tool is often installed and used alongside Pixar's RenderMan production renderer on Linux based headless render nodes.

<https://renderman.pixar.com/tractor>

A tractor license entitlement is often provided with RenderMan commercial licenses. This is defined as a "FeatureInfo" block in your Pixar.license file:

    <FeatureInfo>
        <FeatureName>Tractor</FeatureName>
        <FeatureVersion>2.000</FeatureVersion>
        <ExpirationDate>22-jul-2023</ExpirationDate>
        <FeatureCount>10</FeatureCount>
        <FeatureCode>...</FeatureCode>
        <ExtraData></ExtraData>
    </FeatureInfo>

Tractor is also available separately as a standalone offering which can be purchased with maintenance from the Pixar RenderMan team sales staff.

### Controlling Tractor

### Tractor and macOS Port Ranges

Tractor and macOS Port Ranges

When running Tractor Blade on macOS systems it is important to change the default port number from trying to open a new connection to port 80. A popular alternative port number to use is 8080.

For compatibility reasons, a higher port range number has to be defined manually in the Tractor preference files to avoid Tractor communication messages being blocked by the macOS network rules.

The command-line syntax to start a Tractor Blade engine on port 8080 is:

    # Start Tractor Blade
    /opt/pixar/Tractor-2.4/bin/tractor-blade --engine=tractor-engine:8080 &

### Sharp Keys Based Keyboard Remapping for Windows

Sharp Keys Based Keyboard Remapping for Windows

The Sharp Keys utility for Windows is excellent if you need to modify the default key bindings of a specific key on your keyboard. This is typically required when using a macOS keyboard with Control/Option/Command keys connected to a remote access session hosted on a Windows PC.

[Microsoft App Store \| SharpKeys](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/sharpkeys/XPFFCG7M673D4F)

You have a useful option with the Sharp Keys utility of being able modify both the left and right side "Windows" keys on your keyboard to an alternative kep mapping.

![[img/image225.png]]

Or you could choose to bind only a single Windows key (like the left Windows key) to an alternative key mapping. This allows you the flexibility to occasionally access the original unmodified right Windows key.

### Maya.env File Settings

Maya.env File Settings

A Maya.env file is used to hold environment variable settings for a specific Maya release version.

The initial Maya.env file can be created on Linux using:

    sudo mkdir -p $HOME/maya/2023/
    sudo chmod -R 777 $HOME/maya/
    nano $HOME/maya/2023/Maya.env

When editing this file you can paste in:

    # Suppress Arnold not found error message:
    MAYA_NO_WARNING_FOR_MISSING_DEFAULT_RENDERER=1

    # Set the CIP disable flag:
    MAYA_DISABLE_CIP=1

### Running Maya Batch from the Linux Command-Line

Running Maya Batch from the Linux Command-Line

The batch version of Maya can be run on render node systems using:

    maya -batch --help

    Render -help
    Usage: Render [options] filename
           where "filename" is a Maya ASCII or a Maya binary file.

    Common options:
      -help              Print help
      -test              Print Mel commands but do not execute them
      -verb              Print Mel commands before they are executed
      -keepMel           Keep the temporary Mel file
      -listRenderers     List all available renderers
      -renderer string   Use this specific renderer
      -r string          Same as -renderer
      -proj string       Use this Maya project to load the file
      -log string        Save output into the given file
      -rendersetuptemplate string Apply a render setup template to your scene before command line rendering.  Only templates exported via File > Export All in the Render Setup editor are supported.  Render setting presets and AOVs are imported from the template.  Render settings and AOVs are reloaded after the template if the -rsp and -rsa flags are used in conjunction with this flag.
      -rst string        Same as -rendersetuptemplate
      -rendersettingspreset string Apply the scene Render Settings from this template file before command line rendering.  This is equivalent to performing File > Import Scene Render Settings in the Render Setup editor, then batch rendering.
      -rsp string        Same as -rendersettingspreset
      -rendersettingsaov string Import the AOVs from this json file before command line rendering.
      -rsa string        Same as -rendersettingsaov

    Specify a valid -r option to get a more detailed help about a renderer.
    For example: Render -help -r sw

To check the current Maya version you can run:

    maya -batch -v
    # Maya 2020, Cut Number 202011110415

You can verify that Maya has been registered and activated by a network or log-in license using the following command-line licensing utility:

    /opt/Autodesk/AdskLicensing/9.2.1.2399/helper/AdskLicensingInstHelper list

If successful, Maya should appear in the list of products returned by the Adsk Licensing Inst Helper utility. A sample output from running the executable looks like this:

    [
      {
        "feature_id": "MAYA",
        "def_prod_key": "657L1",
        "def_prod_ver": "2020.0.0.F",
        "sel_prod_key": "657L1",
        "sel_prod_ver": "2020.0.0.F",
        "supported_lic_methods": [
          2,
          1,
          4
        ],
        "lic_servers": [
          ""
        ],
        "serial_number_sa": "...",
        "serial_number_nw": "...",
        "def_prod_code": "MAYA",
        "sel_prod_code": "MAYA"
      }
    ]

Manually creating a License.env file

    sudo nano /usr/autodesk/maya2020/bin/License.env

Used a text editor to add your network licensing details to the License.env file

    MAYA_LICENSE=657L1
    MAYA_LICENSE_METHOD=network

Manually creating a maya.lic license file

    sudo nano /var/flexlm/maya.lic

Add your floating license server details to the maya.lic text file:

    SERVER R1 0
     USE_SERVER

At this point you should add "`/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/R17/lib64/`" directory temporarily to the "`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`" environment variables to set your shared libraries for this session.

For example, you can run the following command in a BASH shell:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/R17/lib64/

It is a good idea to backup the old Maya licensing .pit file:

    sudo mv /var/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/Maya2020/MayaConfig.pit /var/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/Maya2020/MayaConfig.pit.bak
    sudo rm -rf /var/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/Maya2020/MayaConfig.pit

Now you can run the following commands to register Maya with the Autodesk licensing app:

In the following example the serial number is represented as `<...>` for a snipped out value to be replaced with your own code.

An example Maya product key is 657L1 (which is used for Maya 2020).

    {
    cd /usr/autodesk/maya2020/bin

    /usr/autodesk/maya2020/bin/adlmreg -i N 657L1 657L1 2020.0.0.F <...> /var/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/Maya2020/MayaConfig.pit
    }

When deploying a new Linux based render node, if a Maya network license was not listed by the Adsk Licensing Inst Helper utility, you can manually register a license using a command line syntax that looks roughly like this:

    sudo /opt/Autodesk/AdskLicensing/9.2.1.2399/helper/AdskLicensingInstHelper register -pk 657L1 -pv 2020.0.0.F -el EN_US -cf /var/opt/Autodesk/Adlm/Maya2020/MayaConfig.pit

If the licensing service is not running, you can start it using the following command.

Note: When running a program with a service based approach, the executable will continue to run in the session.

    sudo /opt/Autodesk/AdskLicensing/9.2.1.2399/AdskLicensingService/AdskLicensingService --run

Verify the licensing service is running using:

    sudo systemctl status adsklicensing

    # ● adsklicensing.service - Autodesk Licensing Service
    #    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/adsklicensing.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
    #    Active: active (running) since Fri 2021-04-23 14:40:20 ADT; 1min 5s ago
    #  Main PID: 26769 (AdskLicensingSe)
    #     Tasks: 33
    #    CGroup: /system.slice/adsklicensing.service
    #            └─26769 /usr/bin/AdskLicensingService --run
    #  Apr 23 14:40:20 Moonraker systemd[1]: Started Autodesk Licensing Service.

You should verify again if the service is running. If it is still not running, set up the licensing service manually:

    {
    sudo getent group adsklic &>/dev/null || sudo groupadd adsklic
    sudo id -u adsklic &>/dev/null || sudo useradd -M -r -g adsklic adsklic -d / -s /usr/sbin/nologin
    sudo ln -sf /opt/Autodesk/AdskLicensing/9.2.1.2399/AdskLicensingService/AdskLicensingService /usr/bin/AdskLicensingService
    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/systemd/system
    sudo cp -f /opt/Autodesk/AdskLicensing/9.2.1.2399/AdskLicensingService/adsklicensing.el7.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/adsklicensing.service
    sudo chmod 644 /usr/lib/systemd/system/adsklicensing.service
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable adsklicensing
    sudo systemctl start adsklicensing
    }

#### Installing V-Ray Universal Render Node

Installing V-Ray Universal Render Node

Chaos Group sells monthly or annual V-Ray license subscriptions that provide access to a dedicated cross-platform "Universal" render node program.

This executable supports the creation of render farms that can process content coming from a wide range of host DCC (digital-content creation) packages. All that is needed is for the DCC program to use a V-Ray plugin to export standalone .vrscene files.

![[img/image92.png]]

#### V-Ray Installer XML-Based Config Files

V-Ray Installer XML-Based Config Files

After you run the V-Ray installer program, you have the option of saving a config file to disk that holds all of your choices. This config file is exported using the XML file format.

The config file is particularly helpful when carrying out numerous V-Ray Universal Render Node deployment tasks on a render farm since the installer program allows you to run the executable from a text-based SSH shell session:

    sudo ./vray_adv_52003_maya2023_centos7 -configFile="/home/vfx/config_vray.xml" -ignoreErrors=1

#### V-Ray Licensing Preference File

V-Ray Licensing Preference File

When V-Ray is used with a network license checkout option, a file is created on-disk named:

    $HOME/.ChaosGroup/vrlclient.xml

Since the ".ChaosGroup" folder starts with a period character it is typically hidden on macOS and Linux filesystems by default.

A vrlclient.xml file that does a network license checkout will typically look like this document:

    <VRLClient>
        <LicServer>
            <Host>R1</Host>
            <Port>30304</Port>
            <Host1></Host1>
            <Port1>30304</Port1>
            <Host2></Host2>
            <Port2>30304</Port2>
            <User></User>
            <Pass></Pass>
        </LicServer>
    </VRLClient>

The Host field can hold either a hostname or IP address. This value can be customized visually by the V-Ray installer program to point to your LAN's V-Ray license server system.

#### Manually Starting V-Ray Server

Manually Starting V-Ray Server

If you need direct control over a V-Ray DR process you can manually start the vrayserver executable from a command-prompt/terminal session.

Here is a Linux based example:

    sudo /usr/ChaosGroup/V-Ray/Maya2023-x64/bin/vrayserver

Here is a Windows based example:

    cd /usr/ChaosGroup/V-Ray/Maya2023-x64/bin
    sudo ./registerVRayServerDaemon
    sudo ./startVRayServerDaemon

#### V-Ray DR Check

V-Ray DR Check

The V-Ray DR Check utility is available on all supported host operating systems. The tool lets you see the specifics for a running V-Ray Universal Render Node session. You need to specify the exact hostname or IP address for a render node system along with a port number. The default V-Ray DR port number is 20207.

    /usr/ChaosGroup/V-Ray/Maya2023-x64/bin/vraydr_check -host=10.20.30.2 -port=20207

On macOS and Linux systems it is possible to check if multiple concurrent V-Ray rendering processes are active, or stalled, on a render node using the terminal-based ps utility with the output piped into grep:

    echo "[List V-Ray Processes]"
    ps -edf | grep "vray\.bin"

#### V-Ray Distributed Rendering

V-Ray Distributed Rendering

When project deadlines are fast approaching, having a render farm with the V-Ray Universal Render Node program installed on multiple nodes is an excellent resource to use for V-Ray DR (Distributed Rendering). This V-Ray DR technique will dramatically accelerate the final-frame and interactive rendering performance of an artist's interactive GUI session.

With DR active in your V-Ray render sessions, artists have the option to access multiple render nodes concurrently, and will be able to use that hardware to perform faster interactive lighting and "look development" in programs that have a full-featured V-Ray integration plugin like Maya, Houdini, and 3DS Max.

This V-Ray distributed rendering approach is discussed in the following article:

#### V-Ray Scene Render for Fusion Fuse

V-Ray Scene Render for Fusion Fuse

[WSL \[BETA\] kvrVraySceneRender Fuse Thread Post](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=40575#p40575)

Render V-Ray based .vrscene file assets interactively from the V-Ray VFB window, from within the comfort of a Resolve/Fusion GUI or Fusion Render Node session, via V-Ray Universal Render Node command-line interface bindings.

![[img/image375.jpg]]

GUI Controls

![[img/image386.jpg]]

The VRScene Filename control supports the use of PathMaps and %04d style frame padding characters.

The EXR Filename control supports the use of PathMaps and %04d style frame padding characters.

The "Static Frame" control allows you to load either a (static) single image, or an image sequence.

The "Interactive" control allows you to have the rendering launched during a Fusion Studio GUI artist session. When this control is unchecked, renderings are only carried out during batch renders.

The "Skip Rendering if image exists" checkbox allows you to make sure you aren't re-rendering the same frame again. This control will look for the expected image name on-disk and only launch a rendering of a new image if no image file is found.

Workflow Notes

This fuse works with Cryptomatte since a "Metadata.Filename" record is added automatically to the image output stream that is generated by the V-Ray Batch Render fuse. This metadata information allows Cryptomatte masking operations to work in Fusion if the VRScene file being rendered has the Cryptomatte render element enabled.

Dev Todo Sooner List

-   Error handling - missing V-Ray host program error is mis-identified as a missing scene
-   Drag and drop import .vrscene file into Fusion comp view
-   Parse the vrscene file on drag/drop import to look for scene filename token
-   "Open VRScene in Script Editor" Button - Open the file with the Script editor defined in the Fusion preferences
-   V-Ray Bin hosts on macOS/Win/Linux selector

Dev Todo Later List

-   Customize EXR Filename
-   Render Element Override controls
-   Figure out multi-rendering of same frame issue
-   Check-point auto-save image every N minutes
-   Get EXR image name from popen() result
-   Batch vs interactive rendering
-   VFB project workspace - save history tab path

#### RenderMan for Fusion (TF31 Plugin)

RenderMan for Fusion (TF31 Plugin)

Marcel Gandriau (Tolosa Films) has a new RenderMan v24 for Fusion plugin that is under development for Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio. The plugin is able to work with RenderMan's paid and NC (Non-Commercial) editions.

This image shows the Eisko Louise character asset from the RenderMan learning page being used with the TF31 RenderMan for Fusion plugin:

![[img/image64.png]]

This image shows a plush dragon model with alembic hair curves. The asset is from the RenderMan learning page and it is shown in a Fusion composite that uses the TF31 RenderMan for Fusion plugin:

![[img/image187.png]]

This image shows the Cookies and Milk assets from the RenderMan learning page in a Fusion composite that uses the TF31 RenderMan for Fusion plugin:

![[img/image57.png]]

The TF31 integration plugin provides Fusion-based artists with access to Pixar's RenderMan software which is a high-quality film-level production renderer that can be used to raytrace a detailed 2D scene with reflections, refractions, subsurface shading, advanced lighting including light-filters, and render-time procedural features like Xgen Hair.

This makes it possible to use Fusion's 3D workspace and node-graph to author native RenderMan .rib formatted scene description files. This RIB formatted content is exported to disk by a Renderer3D node, and rendered using RenderMan Pro Server.

There is a handy "RigExtractor" command-line utility included with the TF31 plugin. It is used to translate RenderMan for Maya, and RenderMan for Blender exported .rib files into Fusion node-graph based comps with underlays:

    RibExtractor <YourRenderManScene.rib> <directory>

An early-access version of the TF31 plugin runs today with Fusion Studio v18 on macOS (Intel x64) and Windows 10/11 systems. It is available in limited release as a beta version hosted on the Steakunderwater forum's [FusionSDK zone](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?t=5552) (A WSL forum login with FusionSDK access permissions added is required to view this link).

#### RenderMan NC (Non-Commercial) Installer Download

RenderMan NC (Non-Commercial) Installer Download

The Pixar RenderMan learning website provides access to a [downloadable copy of RenderMan v24 NC (Non-Commercial)](https://renderman.pixar.com/store).

Click the "Free to Try" button to register for a free RenderMan account that allows you to download the RenderMan DCC plugin, RenderMan Pro Server, and LocalQueue.

![[img/image288.png]]

The current (as of 2022-11-25) RenderMan NC v24.4 release for macOS has the filename of:

    RenderMan-InstallerNCR-24.4.0_2226589-osxMojave_clang10.x86_64.dmg

#### Fixing a PRMan Installer Disk Permissions Issue

Fixing a PRMan Installer Disk Permissions Issue

In order for the macOS based RenderMan NC installer to be able to write the files to disk it is a good idea to add the "RenderMan Installer.app" file to the "System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \> Privacy \> Full Disk Access" section. Make sure to enable the checkbox by that entry's name in the dialog.

Additionally, you can temporarily change the folder permissions on the Pixar folder to make installing files easier:

    sudo chmod -R 777 /Applications/Pixar/

Once these changes have been made you can run the "RenderMan Installer.app" program and the RPS (RenderMan Pro Server) and RFM (RenderMan for Maya) installs will complete successfully.

![[img/image55.png]]

If you don't make the macOS disk permission changes, the first time the RenderMan installer is run it will generate and save the "pixar.license" license file to disk. Unfortunately the RenderMan installer will then report a disk permission write access issue on macOS Monterey which causes the installer to fail at the stage of creating the "RenderManProServer-24.4" and "RenderManForMaya-24.4" sub-folders in the Pixar directory. This error stage cancels the reset of the install process.

![[img/image315.png]]![[img/image301.png]]

#### Configuring RenderMan Environment Variables

Configuring RenderMan Environment Variables

If you want to use the RenderMan for Fusion (TF31) plugin, or RenderMan Pro Server, it helps to add several environment variables to your system.

macOS Environment Variables

Since macOS Monterey uses ZSH for the default terminal, I created a "\$HOME/.zshenv" file and added the following content to the text file:

    export RMSTREE=/Applications/Pixar/RenderManForMaya-24.4
    export RMANTREE=/Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-24.4
    export RFMTREE=/Applications/Pixar/RenderManForMaya-24.4
    export RFM_VERSION=24.4
    export RFM_MAYA_VERSION=2023
    export PIXAR_LICENSE_FILE=/Applications/Pixar/pixar.license

Windows Environment Variables

On Windows 10/11 you can use the System Control Panel to add the following environment variable entries. Some of these entries will be automatically added for you by the RenderMan installer.

    RMANTREE=C:\Program Files\Pixar\RenderManProServer-24.4\
    RFMTREE=C:\Program Files\Pixar\RenderManForMaya-24.4\
    RFM_VERSION=24.4
    RFM_MAYA_VERSION=2023
    PIXAR_LICENSE_FILE=C:\Program Files\Pixar\pixar.license
    PATH=C:\Program Files\Pixar\RenderManProServer-24.4\bin;C:\Program Files\Pixar\RenderManProServer-24.4\lib

#### Using the RenderMan for Fusion (TF31) Plugin

Using the RenderMan for Fusion (TF31) Plugin

Install The TF31 Plugin

Copy the TF31 plugin files into one of the Fusion "Plugins:/" PathMap supported folder locations on-disk.

On Windows you need to add the following RenderMan Pro Server library files to the Plugins folder:

-   libprman.dll (from Pixar/RenderManProServer-xx.x/lib/)
-   libpxrcore.dll (from Pixar/RenderManProServer-xx.x/bin/)
-   libstats.dll (from Pixar/RenderManProServer-xx.x/bin/)

The TF31 plugin bundled files include:

-   RibRendererMac.plugin or RibRendererWin.plugin
-   aovs.json
-   tf31.tif

The "tf31.tif" image is the default placeholder texture map that is applied to 3D models when they are viewed in the Fusion 3D workspace's viewer window context. The image shows a RenderMan "R" shaped logo:

![[img/image295.png]]

Launch Fusion Studio

On macOS, if you defined your RenderMan environment variables using a \$HOME/.zshenv file you can start Fusion Studio v18 from a terminal session using:

    "/Applications/Blackmagic Fusion 18/Fusion.app/Contents/MacOS/Fusion" -verbose -clean -log "$HOME/Desktop/Fusion_log.txt"

On Windows, you can start Fusion Studio v18 from a command-prompt session using:

    "C:\Program Files\Blackmagic Design\Fusion 18\Fusion.exe" /verbose /clean /log "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\Fusion_log.txt"

Launching Fusion Studio from a terminal/command-prompt window is useful for troubleshooting purposes as it lists detailed diagnostic logging information, and saves error messages to a log file on-disk as well, if there are any issues.

#### Check the TF31 Plugin Version

Check the TF31 Plugin Version

If you want to see what version of the TF31 plugin you have installed, select the "Fusion Studio \> About Fusion Studio" menu entry. This will open the "About Fusion Window".

Then click on one of the TF31 plugin's nodes, in the list on the lower left part of the window, to see the exact build date.

![[img/image186.png]]

#### The Tools Menu

The Tools Menu

The RenderMan for Fusion nodes are accessible in Fusion Studio using the "Tools \> TF31 \> pxr \>" menus.

![[img/image310.png]]

#### Fusion Preferences

Fusion Preferences

The plugin has its own Fusion preference page found at:

Global and Default Settings \> Rib

![[img/image329.png]]

#### Creating RenderMan Node Graphs in Fusion

Creating RenderMan Node Graphs in Fusion

![[img/image188.png]]

If you are building a new RenderMan scene in Fusion, the typical node-connections used with the TF31 plugin are:

    TF31PxrSurface -> TF31PxrSG
    TF31PxrSG -> Shape3D
    Shape3D -> Merge3D
    TF31PxrCamera -> Merge3D
    TF31PxrRectLight -> Merge3D
    Merge3D -> Renderer3D

The "TF31PxrSurface" node is the Pixar surface material node.

The "TF31PxrSG" node represents a typical Autodesk Maya style shading group.

The "TF31PxrCamera" node is used to add a Pixar camera to the scene.

The "TF31PxrRectLight" node is a rectangular area light.

#### Renderer3D Node

Renderer3D Node

The "Renderer3D" node is used to define the render-time output settings for a Fusion 3D scene graph.

When creating a new Fusion 3D comp, you need to change the Renderer3D node's "Render Type" setting from outputting the scene using a typical OpenGL or software rendering setting over to using the "Rib Renderer''. This allows a RenderMan .rib file to be generated.

![[img/image8.png]]

The Renderer3D node has a "Preview" button that can be used to export a .rib file that holds the 3D scene graph information. When the Preview button is pressed an additional RenderMan Tractor Render Manager/LocalQueue based "Alfred" .alf job description file is created at the same time.

This "Alfred" .alf file streamlines the process of using RenderMan Pro Server to create renderings in the background without blocking a Fusion Studio GUI based artist session.

![[img/image326.png]]

#### TF31PxrAlembic Node

TF31PxrAlembic Node

It is possible to bypass Fusion's AlembicMesh3D node and import Alembic data natively using a "TF31PxrAlembic" node. This native mesh loading node allows attributes like subdivision surface creases to be retained.

Surface Material Previews

Note: When RenderMan surface materials are displayed in the real-time Fusion 3D viewer window contexts you will see a place-holder texture map on the 3D models that features a repeating pattern of a small RenderMan "R" shaped logo on all of the surfaces.

![[img/image358.png]]

#### Rendering Exported RIB Files Using RenderMan Pro Server

Rendering Exported RIB Files Using RenderMan Pro Server

After you export a .rib file to disk, you are able to render it directly from a terminal window on a macOS system using a shell command like:

    /Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-24.4/bin/prman "$HOME/Documents/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/test/ribs/test_000.rib"

The rib file will typically render an OpenEXR formatted image to disk with the .openexr file extension. You can view the image in the "IT.app" utility.

![[img/image116.png]]

#### RenderMan Lacks ARM64 Native Support

RenderMan Lacks ARM64 Native Support

Note: At the current moment you cannot use the TF31 plugin on a macOS system with an Apple ARM64 architecture based CPU. You need to run the TF31 plugin on a native Intel x64 based macOS system or a Hackintosh.

This is due to the Pixar RenderMan SDK's lack of ARM64 compatible include/header/libraries in the currently shipping version of RenderMan Pro Server. Hopefully this ARM64 support issue will be fixed when Autodesk Maya ships with ARM64 native support, and the RenderMan for Maya plugin also ships with ARM64 support as well.

In the meantime you will see this error message on a macOS ARM64 system if you run the TF31 plugin inside of Fusion Studio.

![[img/image341.png]]

#### What the heck is a Fusion Plugins Blocklist File?

What the heck is a Fusion Plugins Blocklist File?

If you have a Fusion 3rd party plugin loading issue during Fusion Studio's startup process you will typically see an error message that starts with the words "Unable to load plugin".

![[img/image169.png]]

After the plugin fails to load an entry is added automatically to the file:

    %appdata%\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Profiles\Default\Plugins17.blocklist

This blocklist file is used to stop recurring Fusion Studio startup error messages from being displayed in the future.

The blocklist file contents will typically look like this:

    {
        { "C:/ProgramData/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Reactor/Deploy/Plugins/RibRenderer.plugin", 1666459470000 }
    }

After you correct the issue that caused the 3rd party plugin's error state to occur, you can remove the entry that was added in the Plugins17.blocklist file. This allows the plugin to be used in the future.

#### Houdini Environment Variables

Houdini Environment Variables

If you need to keep a Houdini project file organized and make sure the asset filepaths are up-to-date, you can use the following tokens as placeholders in filename fields. The tokens will be evaluated automatically when the node graph is cooked at render time:

    $F4 = 4 digits of frame padding on the current frame number
    $HQHOSTS = The name of the current render node that is processing this frame chunk
    $HFS = The path to the Houdini program files folder where the houdini setup shell script is stored inside of
    $HIP = The path to the folder where the current Houdini .hip file is stored
    $HIPNAME = The name of the current Houdini .hip file

#### SideFX HQueue Render Manager

SideFX HQueue Render Manager

HQueue is a cross-platform compatible network render manager program with a Web-based user interface that comes from SideFX software. It is a license-free toolset that can be installed on an unlimited number of render nodes without requiring a Houdini license.

##### Step 1.

Step 1.

Modify the HQROOT entries from your HQServer "network_folders.ini" file's settings to a local dummy folder like:

    HQROOT
    C:\HQShared

Also create a Windows based system environment variable for:

    HQROOT = C:\HQShared  

Edit the "`C:\HQClient\hqnode.ini`" file so the server is set to:

    [main]
    server = 10.20.30.4
    port = 5000

    [job_environment]

##### Step 2.

Step 2.

In TOPs, clear out the pre-existing "PDG Path Map" fields.

Set the "topnet1" node to use a "Default Scheduler" entry like:

    localscheduler (local only jobs)

or

    hqueuescheduler1 (network jobs)

##### Step 3.

Step 3.

Inside the current task area set the "hqueuescheduler" node to use:

    HQueue Server:
    http://localhost:5000
    or
    http://10.20.30.4:5000

    HFS:
        [ ] Universal HFS (Clear out)
        Linux HFS Path: (Clear out)
        macOS HFS Path: (Clear out)
        Windows HFS Path: $HFS

Paths:

Load Item Data From: Temporary JSON File

Uncheck "\[ \] Compress work item data".

##### Step 4.

Step 4.

Press the "U" key in the nodes view area to navigate back to the top-level tasks view.

Select "topnet1" in the nodes view.

To launch a new batch network render, click on the "Dirty All" button to clear out any render progress information. Then click on "Cook Output Node".

##### Popular HQueue Errors

Popular HQueue Errors

    Error: localsharedroot path not found.

This happens if a dummy `$HQROOT` value is not entered.

Note: With "RPC Message Passing" the render job fails, so use JSON temp files instead.

Note: Don't use a fully expanded absolute filepath for the Windows SideFX Houdini folder in place of `$HFS`, or it will error the job.

#### Render Fusion Comps in Houdini TOPs

Render Fusion Comps in Houdini TOPs

A Houdini TOPs based node graph can be used to create workflow automation projects in a visual interface. It is another way to control a task that would otherwise need to be run as a Deadline Render Manager based job using a custom submitter.

It is possible to use Houdini TOPs to control image processing workflows:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l9L-LhCxTobZmRlinu3oKUM61EuqtZJmcf_Tv1VG-8Q/edit>

#### Distributing a Houdini TOPs Job With HQueue

Distributing a Houdini TOPs Job With HQueue

![[img/image22.png]]

Shortly after you create your first TOPs job in Houdini, you will feel the need to speed up your render time and output volume through another layer of automation. This is where distributed compute techniques come into play.

Houdini includes the (free) HQueue render farm controller program that should likely be your first port-of-call in distributing a TOPs based task to render nodes.

If you eventually out-grow the features provided by the bundled HQueue render manager, you also have the option of distributing a TOPs job using Pixar's Tractor render manager, or the Amazon AWS Thinkbox Deadline render manager.

#### Configuring HQueue on Windows

Configuring HQueue on Windows

Here are a few tips to help you configure a fresh install of HQueue.

As a small observation, when working in a small render farm, the act of pointing the HQROOT path at your storage server's primary volume, tends to just cause headaches when you only have one shared hard disk for the whole file server.

Also, it helps to segment your HQueue Pools into separate groups per operating system. Don't mix and match them unless you have taken the time to set up and fully customize environment variables for use on any OS specific value you need to rely on in a TOPs job.

##### Step 1. {#ref1}

Step 1.

Modify the HQROOT entries from your HQServer "network_folders.ini" file's settings to a local dummy folder like:

    HQROOT
    C:\HQShared

Also create a Windows based system environment variable for:

    HQROOT = C:\HQShared

Edit the "`C:\HQClient\hqnode.ini`" file so the server is set to:

    [main]
    server = 10.20.30.2
    port = 5000

    [job_environment]

##### Step 2. {#ref2}

Step 2.

In TOPs, clear out the pre-existing "PDG Path Map" fields.

Set the "topnet1" node to use:

    Default Scheduler:
    localscheduler (local only jobs) 
    or
    hqueuescheduler1 (network jobs)

##### Step 3. {#ref3}

Step 3.

Then inside the current task area:

Set the "hqueuescheduler" node to use:

HQueue Server:

You can connect as localhost if HQueue is running on the same system as Houdini:

<http://localhost:5000>

Or you can enter the server's fixed IP v4 address like:

http://10.20.30.4:5000

    HFS:
    [ ] Universal HFS (Clear out)
    Linux HFS Path: (Clear out)
    macOS HFS Path: (Clear out)
    Windows HFS Path: $HFS

    Paths:
    Load Item Data From: Temporary JSON File
    Uncheck "[ ] Compress work item data".

##### Step 4. {#ref4}

Step 4.

Press the "U" key in the node view context to navigate back to the top level Tasks view.

Select "topnet1" in the nodes view.

To launch a new batch network render, click on the "Dirty All" button to clear out any render progress information. Then click on "Cook Output Node".

##### Popular HQueue Error Messages

Popular HQueue Error Messages

`Error: localsharedroot path not found.`

This happens if a dummy `$HQROOT` value is not entered.

Note: If you enabled the TOPs based parameter for "RPC Message Passing", and the render job fails each time it is run, a workaround is to switch over to using JSON temp files instead. JSON temp files on the small scale can be more reliable and easier to manage on a small farm.

Note: Don't try to manually enter a fully expanded absolute filepath that points to the Windows SideFX Houdini folder, in place of the \$HFS environment variable. Doing this will likely result in rendering errors when you cook a TOPs job.

## Photogrammetry Tools

Photogrammetry Tools

### Agisoft Metashape Deployment

Agisoft Metashape Deployment

Metashape is a popular Russian-made photogrammetry toolset that has cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

<https://www.agisoft.com/>

The Metashape standard edition is very affordable. The professional version adds video processing, GPS coordinates, more advanced control registration options, command-line support, Python scripting access, and render cluster option for using multiple computers to process more data. It is possible to create high-quality MVS (Multi-View Stereo) generated depthmaps using Metashape Pro and its Python scripting interface.

Note: The Agisoft Metashape software was previously known as Agisoft Photoscan prior to 2018.

#### Checking Metashape Command-Line Parameters

Checking Metashape Command-Line Parameters

If you need to check the current command-line parameters available in Metashape Pro, run the following code in the command-prompt:

"C:\\Program Files\\Agisoft\\Metashape Pro\\metashape.exe" --help

![[img/image214.png]]

#### Setting up an AGI Metashape Pro Render Cluster

Setting up an AGI Metashape Pro Render Cluster

Let's enable network processing of data in Metashape Pro.

    # Start a single server instance and make sure all storage is NFS or SMB based.
    "C:\Program Files\Agisoft\Metashape Pro\metashape.exe" --server --control 10.20.30.1 --dispatch 10.20.30.1
      
    # Start up cluster nodes 
    "C:\Program Files\Agisoft\Metashape Pro\metashape.exe" --node --dispatch 10.20.30.1

When you are in a Metashape Pro based GUI session, you should now enable the network processing option in the prefs.

Switch in the Metashape Preferences window to the "Network" tab. Make sure to type in the address of the server that is controlling the whole compute farm into the "Host name" field. In my case this is a system with the IP address of "10.20.30.1". If you are running the session on your own local computer you can stick with the default value of "127.0.0.1".

![[img/image257.png]]

#### KartaVR Metashape Automation Script

KartaVR Metashape Automation Script

KartaVR provides a "Send to Photoscan" script that allows you to export Loader/Saver based media from a Fusion composite into a new Agisoft Metashape .psx project file.

![[img/image393.png]]

For More information

-   [Send Media to Photoscan Docs](https://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#send-media-to-photoscan)
-   [YouTube \| Send Media to Photoscan Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t0w1Y3tRb8)

With this Lua script you can select as many loader and saver node clips as you want in the Fusion flow area and all of those images will be added to the same "chunk" in the new AGI Photoscan project.

![[img/image63.png]]

When a loader node with an image sequence is selected, the full frame range of the footage that is configured in the loader node will be sent to AGI Metashape as individual images. If a saver node is selected then an image sequence will be sent to AGI Metashape using the renderable start to end frame range values.

The standard edition of Agisoft Metashape only knows how to open up JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, EXR, TGA, PGM, PBM, and DNG images.

If you have several video clips that you would like to use in Metashape standard edition then you should run that footage through the KartaVR [Convert Movies to Image Sequences](https://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#convert-movies-to-image-sequences) script first and it will process a folder full of movie files and output ready to use image sequences.

### Reality Capture PPI Deployment

Reality Capture PPI Deployment

Reality Capture is a Windows based photogrammetry toolset that was acquired by Epic Games.

<https://www.capturingreality.com/RealityCapture-PPI>

Reality Capture heavily relies on a NVIDIA CUDA GPU to perform the multi-view image registration and alignment stages. Reality Capture supports the use of a Windows command-prompt based command-line interface for automation.

Reality Capture's best strength is being able to import and work with tens of thousands of images from a photogrammetry scanning project. You don't have to pre-filter the camera views to the same extent that other photogrammetry tools require.

Reality Capture scene export parameters can be saved into an XML based file format:

    <ModelExport exportBinary="1" exportInfoFile="1" exportVertices="1" exportVertexColors="0"
       exportVertexNormals="0" exportTriangles="1" exportTexturing="1" meshColor="4294967295"
       tileType="0" exportTextureAlpha="0" exportToOneTexture="0" oneTextureMaxSide="16384"
       oneTextureUsePow2TexSide="1" exportCoordinateSystemType="1" settingsAnchor="0 0 0"
       settingsScalex="1" settingsScaley="1" settingsScalez="1" texturesFileType="png"
       formatAndVersionUID="obj 000 " exportModelByParts="0" exportRandomPartColor="0"
       exportCameras="0" exportCamerasAsModelPart="0" numberAsciiFormatting="%.16e">
      <Header magic="5786949" version="1"/>
    </ModelExport>

Scene cropping in Reality Capture can be saved to a .rcbox file that internally is an XML based file format:

    <ReconstructionRegion globalCoordinateSystem="+proj=geocent +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs" globalCoordinateSystemName="local:1 - Euclidean"
       isGeoreferenced="1" isLatLon="0" yawPitchRoll="0 -0 -0">
      <widthHeightDepth>6.86994028091431 7.52994060516357 6.13969278335571</widthHeightDepth>
      <Header magic="5395016" version="2"/>
      <CentreEuclid>
        <centre>-0.607471704483032 0.591201782226563 12.0405006408691</centre>
      </CentreEuclid>
      <Residual R="1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1" t="0 0 0" s="1"/>
    </ReconstructionRegion>

When automating multi-view Reality Capture workflows, it is helpful to know that the toolset is able to export each of the active camera locators to an XMP metadata format that includes both the transform matrix and lens distortion parameters. XMP data is internally stored in an XML based file format:

        <!-- BoxThickness: base clipping-box dimensions -->
        <!-- Thickness values must be positive -->
        <BoxThickness x="" y="" z=""/>
        <!-- BoxCenter: clipping-box center -->
        <!-- Optional (if not defined, the center of the bounding-box of each entity will be used instead) -->  
        <BoxCenter x="" y="" z=""/>
        <!-- 'Repeat' dimension for cross sections generation. Additional RepeatDims can be added to split in multiple dimensions. -->
        <!-- Can be 0 (X), 1 (Y) or 2 (Z) -->
        <RepeatDim>0</RepeatDim>
        <!-- Gap between two sections (might be negative, but bigger than the (minus) thickness along the repeat dimension). -->
        <!-- Optional (gap = 0 by default) -->
        <RepeatGap>0</RepeatGap>
        <!-- Input/Output folder path -->
        <!-- 'FilePath' key: all files (but XML ones) present in the folder pointed by FilePath will be loaded (previously loaded entities will be removed!) -->
        
        <!-- 'OutputFilePath' key: if defined, output files will be saved in this folder (if not, FilePath will be used or the current folder if neither are defined) -->
        <!-- (Note: output entities are be saved in sub-folders) -->
        <OutputFilePath>E:\Kartaverse\projects\untitled\meshes\obj</OutputFilePath>
        <!-- Use this option if you want to use the previously loaded entities -->
        
        <!--FilePath>E:\Kartaverse\projects\untitled\meshes\obj</FilePath--> 
        <!-- Use this option if you want to sequentially load files in a folder (it requires less memory if you have lots of entities) -->

### MeshLab

MeshLab

MeshLab is an open-source program that is capable of performing point cloud and mesh based editing operations.

The earlier MeshLabServer CLI program has been retired and replaced with a Python scripting layer.

<https://www.meshlab.net/>

### RPLY Binary to ASCII Format PLY Model Converter

RPLY Binary to ASCII Format PLY Model Converter

RPLY is a command-line tool with ANSI C-language source code that allows [Stanford PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)) formatted models and point clouds to be translated between binary and ASCII encoding formats.

<http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/rply/>

### Lib e57

Lib e57

The e57 file format is often used to hold LIDAR laser scanner generated compressed RGB point cloud data, along with RGB imagery, and other data samples.

<http://libe57.org/>

Saving intermediate scan data as a series of e57 files is far more compact to store on-disk than using either a PLY or XYZ based ASCII scene description format representation of the same point cloud records. Working with a data compressed volumetric file format like e57 significantly reduces disk and network bandwidth overhead when processing hundreds of GBs of volumetric information.

### AWS Thinkbox Sequoia

AWS Thinkbox Sequoia

Sequoia is a free point-cloud editing toolset from Amazon AWS. Sequoia is capable of being used with AWS Deadline for batch processing of volumetric information. It supports the export of scan data to e57 files.

<https://www.awsthinkbox.com/sequoia>

### Faro Scene

Faro Scene

The Faro Scene software is used to process LIDAR scan data from FARO brand LIDAR scanners like the Faro Focus model. The MSRP for Faro Scene is approx. \$6500.

<https://www.faro.com/en/Products/Software/SCENE-Software>

![[img/image181.jpg]]

For more information about Faro Scene and Faro Focus Scanners:

-   [Vimeo \| SEPRI (Spanish Language) \| Using a laser scanner to map caves and caverns in Puerto Rico](https://vimeo.com/666185584)

![[img/image159.png]]

Using Faro Scene, a semi-automated approach can be taken to register and align LIDAR information. The Faro Scene integrated masking tools helped to remove and "clip out" the LIDAR scanner tripods from each station scan. Finally, the point clouds are merged into a unified dataset that spans the full length of the scanned environment.

Faro Scene is able to export finished point cloud data into a [compressed e57 file format](http://libe57.org) which is an excellent choice for volumetric post-production workflows.

![[img/image392.png]]![[img/image317.png]]

A Faro Focus 360 LIDAR scanner captures both point cloud data, and RGB color images from an integrated CMOS image sensor. The RGB image data is primarily used to colorize the point cloud samples. Additionally, the same RGB data from the original camera views can be exported from FARO Scene as high-resolution 360VR stitched panoramic images.

The following Faro Focus LIDAR scanner photos were provided by Robert Moreno of La Sociedad Espeleológica de Puerto Rico, Inc. (SEPRI) "Speleological Society of Puerto Rico" [http://sepri.org/](http://mundosubterraneo.org/)

#### Kartaverse OpenUSD Tools

Kartaverse OpenUSD Tools

It's worth mentioning the Kartaverse KartaVR and Vonk data node toolsets unlock several additional export formats in Resolve/Fusion for volumetric data.

##### Export Point Cloud Script

Export Point Cloud Script

The KartaVR Export point cloud script works with the currently selected PointCloud3D node in the Fusion node graph.

![[img/image196.jpg]]

The "Export to Point Cloud" script can also be used to de-compose a Fusion FBXMesh3D loaded OBJ model into its individual vertices when the point cloud is exported.

![[img/image117.jpg]]

KartaVR supports .ma (Maya ASCII) based exports from Fusion 3D system PointCloud3D nodes, and OBJ meshes.

![[img/image242.jpg]]

![[img/image136.jpg]]

##### Vonk 3D Node

Vonk 3D Node

The Vonk data node "v3DToFile" fuse makes it possible to export the PointCloud3D node data to disk in a parametric node-based fashion. This node works in the Fusion Studio and Resolve Studio GUI.

![[img/image180.png]]

Connect a PointCloud3D node's output connection directly to the v3DToFile node input connection:

PointCloud3D.Output -\> v3DToFile.Input

The "Point Cloud Format" ComboControl allows you to select the export format used. Options include: "XYZ ASCII (.xyz)", "PLY ASCII (.ply)", and "PIXAR USDA ASCII (.usda)".

The "Filename" text field supports Vonk vText based connections. This allows you to dynamically generate a filename via data node approaches.

The Filename field contents can include relative PathMap values like "Comp:/" that will be expanded at render time.

If a sub-folder is specified in the filename field, and it is missing at render time, the sub-folders will be re-created automatically when the file is saved to disk. This is helpful if you want to use per--timeline-frame numbered folders in the output filepath.

##### Vonk 3D Example Comp

Vonk 3D Example Comp

There is a Fusion example comp provided with the Vonk data nodes that shows how the v3DToFile workflow is done.

### Impulse Response Simulation

Impulse Response Simulation

Extensive research is underway to explore the feasibility of analytically generating sound [impulse response](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/logicpro/lgcef2af4d05/mac) files from the volumetric scan data.

This approach helps increase the realism of the immersive XR experiences by allowing for a more accurate sound playback of field-recorded sound elements. These techniques can model sound sources and the audio level "fall off" when they are hidden by occlusions (large blocking objects) such as natural caverns, and interior spaces like hallways and tunnels.

### Reaper DAW

Reaper DAW

Reaper is a free open-source DAW software package that is excellent for spatial audio workflows. It doesn't force any preconceptions onto the audio so you can flexibly work with multi-track sound information.

### Comsol Multiphysics Simulations

Comsol Multiphysics Simulations

A friend of the Kartaverse project, Jared Sandrew (from InfiniteWorld), introduced our audio research group to Jason Riggs from Harman International. Jason volunteered his time over multiple sessions, and shared his insights via Zoom on advanced audio workflows, sound impulse response creation, and an overview of acoustic simulation technologies. Part of that effort by Jason was to explain how the [Comsol Multiphysics](https://www.comsol.com/) software is used to pre-visualize detailed and accurate audio environments based upon measured real-world locations for HiFi home audio and automotive audio needs.

Comsol Multiphysics, when combined with the Comsol [acoustics simulation module](https://www.comsol.com/acoustics-module), dramatically expands on what is possible for digitally simulating acoustic environments using hybrid FEM (Finite Element) solvers.

![[img/image235.jpg]]

This is a sample Comsol website image of simulating sound emission from a source like a speaker element:

![[img/image155.png]]

These techniques potentially take the volumetric research further by allowing for a greater understanding of the acoustic properties of the environments such as caves, and visualize how sounds in this space propagate.

![[img/image223.png]]

### Ultrasonic Sounds in Caves

Ultrasonic Sounds in Caves

Through the use of software like Comsol, it is possible to fully visualize and simulate the acoustic properties of how [ultrasonic avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound_avoidance) is used by bats for navigation and hunting insects using sound recordings of bat vocalizations. One can see plots in 2D and in 3D of the sound waves propagating outwards as bats fly through a large underground cavern hunting for insects.

This image shows a real-world ultrasonic audio recording of a pulse train of bat chirps from a cave in Puerto Rico:

## RAW and HDRI Image Processing Tools

RAW and HDRI Image Processing Tools

HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imagery) is able to represent a wider range of visual information through the storage and use of floating point values.

These RGB formatted high-dynamic range pixel samples exceed the typical 8-bit style 0-255 / 0-1 range of color information stored in a JPEG, BMP, or MP4 like file format that is often shown on a traditional computer monitor or mobile phone screen.

HDRI imagery can be created from RAW image data, by merging bracketed photos taken across a wide range of exposure levels, or from 3D renderings. Common file formats for floating-point HDRI image data include EXR, HDR, and TIFF.

In an HDRI image the center region of a super-white "sun" disc shape might read out as an RGB floating point value like 16+ when selected with a color picker. In an 8-bit image this sun disc RGB color value would typically be clamped at an integer value of 255, or a floating point value of 1.0.

### HDRsoft Photomatix Pro

HDRsoft Photomatix Pro

Photomatix Pro is an easy to use HDR image bracket merging tool that features a batch automation interface that allows you to quickly process a large collection of exposure-bracketed images into HDRI media.

With Photomatix's batch processing interface EXR format image output is supported which is an excellent choice for visual effects workflows.

### DxO Optics PhotoLab

DxO Optics PhotoLab

PhotoLab is the continuation of the earlier Nikon RAW photo processing tools. This suite of tools is useful for photogrammetry applications that need to maximize image quality.

Few people have discovered that PhotoLab has a "generally undocumented" command-line interface that can allow for batch image processing.

<https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/>

#### DxO PhotoLab Command-Line Settings

DxO PhotoLab Command-Line Settings

DxO PhotoLab has a CLI module called DopCor (DxO Correction Engine) which allows you to batch process DNG/RAW footage, and apply color correction presets. This is handy for pre-processing media before running photogrammetry workflows such as adding micro-contrast, reducing JPEG/MPEG compression artifacts, or fine tuning color correction settings.

#### PhotoLab Program Paths

PhotoLab Program Paths

PhotoLab v3

Windows:

    C:\Program Files\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\DopCor.exe

macOS:

    /Applications/DXOPhotoLab3.app/Contents/XPCServices/XPCCor12.xpc/Contents/MacOS/XPCCor12

PhotoLab v2

Windows:

    C:\Program Files\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 2\DopCor.exe

macOS:

    /Applications/DXOPhotoLab3.app/Contents/XPCServices/XPCCor12.xpc/Contents/MacOS/XPCCor12

#### DopCor Usage Summary

DopCor Usage Summary

Step 1. Create the DxO PhotoLab temp working folder

    mkdir "%TEMP%\DxO\"

A logfile named "`%TEMP%\DxO\DxO_Output_Log.txt`" is written to disk. Make sure the folder named "`%TEMP%\DxO`" exists in advance by creating the "DxO" sub-folder inside the temporary files folder using the Windows Command Prompt.

Step 2. Place a sample image, and a corresponding .dop sidecar file at:

    REM %TEMP%\DxO\Cam01.0001.jpg
    REM %TEMP%\DxO\Cam01.0001.jpg.dop

Step 3. Run DxO PhotoLab 3's DopCor CLI Program

    "C:\Program Files\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\DopCor.exe" ^
    --debug ^
    --cafsdir="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\Modules" ^
    --cafsdb="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\CAFList3.db" ^
    --oclcache="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3" ^
    --img="%TEMP%\DxO\Cam01.0001.jpg" ^
    --sidecar="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\Presets\2 - Neutral colors.preset" ^
    --output="%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO PhotoLab 3\OutputSettings.xml" ^
    --outputpath="%TEMP%\DxO"

You will need to change the following two DopCor CLI settings to match your current needs:

A)  Edit the '`--img="%TEMP%\DxO\Cam01.0001.jpg" ^`' entry to define the actual image you want to convert. Make sure this filename is unique and doesn't already exist on-disk.

B)  Also define the DxO preset you want to use by editing the entry. (You will need to write in your own custom preset saved to disk from the PhotoLab GUI.)

    '--sidecar="%USERPROFILE%`\AppData`{=tex}`\Local`{=tex}`\DxO`{=tex}`\DxO `{=tex}PhotoLab 3`\Presets`{=tex}\\2 - Neutral colors.preset" \^'.

#### Photolab Command-Line Usage Notes

PhotoLab Command-Line Usage Notes

Note 1: You need to port the DxO PhotoLab "Export to disk" dialog generated macOS .plist formatted "`OutputSettings.plist`" preference file into a Windows based pure XML document for DopCor.exe on Windows to run successfully. This requires you to extract inline encoded XML "blob" data and then save it to an external document.

The DxO PhotoLab 3 on macOS OutputSettings file is located at:

    $HOME/Library/DxO PhotoLab v3/OutputSettings.plist

The DxO PhotoLab 3 on Windows OutputSettings file is located at:

    C:\Users\<User name>\AppData\Local\DxO\DxO.PhotoLab.exe_StrongName_addo3jomrfkt2faiwwfxxb444r1xfvlh\3.2.0.4344\user.config

The encoded blob data is found in the user.config/OutputSettings.plist file here:

Additional tip: If you don't have a valid OutputSettings file specified when running DopCor you will get the CLI error:

    [DopCor|Error] OutputSettings file doesn't exists or is not a valid OutputSettings files
    (Exit code: -1)

Note 2: The Windows Command Prompt window supports the use of the "\^" carat character as a "line-continuing" symbol. If you place this at the the end of each line of text, it allows you to use multi-line text submission that has a carriage return placed after each command. This is far easier to manage in Notepad++ compared to typing in one super long line of text. When the text block that uses the "\^" carat is pasted into the Command Prompt window, the text with "\^" carat character at the end of each line is treated as a single, super long, block of text and the new line characters are ignored. Always copy/paste a final trailing blank (empty) line of text when you run this type of text in the Command Prompt.

Note 3: The DxO DopCor error message "`[DopCor|Error] Parameters file doesn't exist or is not a valid sidecar`" is caused by an invalid `.preset` file being linked into the `--sidecar` parameter. As far as I can tell a `.preset` file is wanted for this attribute, not the typical .dop sidecar file that would be named something like "`image.ext.dop`".

Note 4: DopCor runs with a single stream socket via an XPC remote port connection. So don't try to queue multiple concurrent image streams at the same time on one system as they are handled FIFO (First In, First Out) so you won't see a performance improvement.

DxO uses a tool called "XPCCor" to do remote procedure calls between its app for lower-level image conversions than the CLI offers:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>

This is done with these modules:

-   DOPCor
-   DXF EngineServer
-   XPC Connection
-   XPC Listener

On macOS the executable "remote procedure call" interface program is located at:

## ACES Color Management

ACES Color Management

The ACES color management system is an adopted industry-wide standard for the entertainment sector. All footage and textures used in film, animation, visual effects, and games are created, edited, and displayed with ACES color profiles enabled.

<https://acescentral.com>

"ACEScg" is the color profile used for computer generated imagery.

All digital cinema camera systems have custom vendor specific ACES color profiles.

Finished film and TV projects are delivered as DCPs (digital cinema packages) and DCDM (digital cinema distribution masters). These delivery formats are based around a specific "ACES 2065-1" color encoding standard. This is used for the long-term archiving of all media in the motion picture industry.

Library of Congress DCDM Guide:

[Digital Cinema Initiative Distribution Master (DCDM)](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000177.shtml)

### OpenColorIO

OpenColorIO

As you start to work with media from a wide range of sources, including digital cinema cameras, RAW high-bit-depth footage from 360VR camera rigs, and CG renderings, the need for an end-to-end color managed workflow becomes essential and unavoidable.

Currently, your best option is to consider using an ACES OpenColorIO v1.0.3 based color managed workflow in Fusion Studio v18.1 and Fusion Render Node 18.1.

<https://opencolorio.org/>

OCIO Resources:

-   [ACES Central](https://community.acescentral.com/)
-   [OpenColorIO Documentation](https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
-   [OpenColorIO GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO)
-   [YouTube \| StatixVFX \| Fusion Pipeline - Getting started with OCIO and ACES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfer5VZKe1U)

### Installing OpenColorIO

Installing OpenColorIO

![[img/image388.png]]

Installing OpenColorIO v1.0.3 is done by downloading the resources directly from an OCIO repository, or to install the OCIO config files with the Reactor Package Manager.

Unzip the OCIO files and either store the "aces" folder locally on your laptop/workstation's internal hard disk, or if you are working in a studio environment move the OCIO config folder to a shared mount point on a file server that is accessible to the machines on your local LAN subnet so the Fusion Render Node systems and other computers can access the content.

Next, you need to define a custom environment variable that tells all of the OCIO compatible graphics tools on your system where to find your aces config folder. The environment variable is named "OCIO", and the value you define for that environment variable is the full absolute filepath on your hard disk to the "config.ocio" file.

### Using OpenColorIO in Fusion

Using OpenColorIO in Fusion

With OCIO installed on your system, in Fusion Studio v18.1 you can then add a viewer LUT that allows you to preview footage correctly on your monitor. A viewer LUT allows you to maintain the original working color space and gamut for the footage loaded into your composite, while previewing the content in a correct fashion on your monitor so you will be able to make informed decisions as a compositor.

![[img/image83.png]]

The "OCIOColorspace" node is then used by Fusion's node graph to convert your footage into the right space for your needs.

![[img/image275.png]]

With the OCIOColorspace node selected in the Nodes view you can then access the controls in Fusion's Inspector view. The primary controls you are concerned with in this node are the "Source Space" and "Output Space" settings.

![[img/image210.png]]

When you are working on a large-scale professional media project you will typically receive and deliver footage as ACES 2065-1 formatted content when interfacing with external vendors.

All your in-house compositing, and node-based 360VR/180VR/Fulldome based stitching, paint, and roto operations should be done using ACEScg.

ACEScg usage at your studio also covers all of the imagery that your 3D department renders when they deliver EXR format media to a compositor that contains beauty and denoised RGBA render passes coming from production renderers like RenderMan, V-Ray, Arnold, Redshift, Houdini Karma, or Blender Cycles X.

An important detail for your 3D department to keep in mind, when generating OpenEXR based image sequences from a 3D rendering package, is that you can opt to use a 16-bit half-float framebuffer, with the ZIPS or DWAA codec for your RGBA based beauty pass and denoised content.

The technical passes stored in an EXR file, like Z-depth, cryptomatte, world position, UV, and motion vectors should however be kept as 32-bit float image data for numerical precision reasons. Do not use a lossy compression codec on technical passes as it will create visual artifacts when you go to apply those channels in your compositing workflows.

### Google VR180 Creator

Google VR180 Creator

If you are exploring VR180 workflows with BMD Resolve/Fusion, it is handy to have a copy of the "Google VR180 Creator" program to be able to easily inject the SBS 180 metadata tags into your final MP4 video file.

Step 1. Google in their infinite wisdom removed the VR180 Creator tool from their website recently but a copy of the program for macOS/Windows/Linux is available for download from the [Internet Archive "Wayback Machine" snapshot of the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617180345/https://arvr.google.com/vr180/apps/).

![[img/image98.jpg]]

Step 2. Drag the "VR180 Creator.app" file from the disk image into your macOS Applications folder.

![[img/image37.jpg]]

Step 4. If you are on a macOS Monterey system you will likely have to edit the "System Preferences \> Security & Privacy \> Full Disk Access" settings to allow the application to run.

### KartaLink Media Command

KartaLink Media Command

Media Command is a scriptable interface for batch processing content that resides in your Resolve Media Pool. This streamlines the process of selecting footage, and running automation scripts on those specific items.

When Media Command is launched it automatically scans for Lua and Python scripts that are located on your hard disk inside the "Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/MediaCommand/" folder. These items are added to the "Command Script" ComboMenu in the interface.

If you are a long time Fusion user, you will find the Media Command script was designed to give your Media page content management operations the same power and flexibility as you have with a Fusion page "tool" script in the Fusion nodes view context.

##### Search Controls

Search Controls

The "Type:" ComboMenu allows you to limit the tree view to show only media of a certain format. The menu options are: "All", "Still", "Video", "Video + Audio", "Audio", "Compound", "Fusion", "Generator", "Geometry", "Stereo", "Subtitle", and "Timeline".

![[img/image96.png]]

The "Search:" text field allows you to narrow down the results in the tree view with plain text search of the "Clip Name" and "File Name" records.

![[img/image296.png]]

The "Select: (All) (None) (Invert)" buttons can be used to quickly modify the footage that is selected in the tree view. It is worth noting that the select buttons work on the content that is visible in the tree view at the current moment so you can apply the select buttons to the filtered search results, then flip back to the full unfiltered list of content in the tree view.

![[img/image256.png]]

##### Script Controls

Script Controls

The "Command Script:" ComboMenu allows you to select a Lua or Python script you would like to run.

![[img/image9.png]]

The (Edit) button will open the active command script using the script editor defined in the Fusion preferences.

The (Go!) button will run the active command script and use it to process the media that is selected in the tree view.

![[img/image68.png]]

##### View Controls

View Controls

If the "Keep Open" button is active, the Media Command window will remain open after a script is launched. This is handy if you need to batch process multiple clips in rapid succession. If this button is inactive the Media Command window will close each time a script is run.

The "Console" button toggles the visibility of the Console window. If you need to troubleshoot a script there is likely useful diagnostic information already visible in the Console.

The "Refresh" button allows you to reload the tree view listing. This is something you might want to do after modifying the content in the Media Pool/Media page, or if you have changed the currently active bin.

![[img/image151.png]]

##### Script Usage

Script Usage

Step 1. Place your custom .lua or .py scripts into the "Reactor:/Deploy/Scripts/MediaCommand/" folder.

Step 2. Launch the Media Command script from the Resolve "Workspaces \> Scripts \> Edit \> Kartaverse \> KartaLink \> Media Command" menu entry.

Step 3. Select the footage you would like to batch process by clicking on the tree view row entries in the Media Command window. At the moment you need to click on the actual "text" words on the row to toggle the "selected" checkbox state.

Step 4. Choose a script you would like to run on the selected media using the "Command Script" ComboMenu, then press the "Go" button.

#### Creating a Media Command Script

Creating a Media Command Script

When a script is launched it has an "args" global variable that holds a plain text formatted Lua table structure.

Note: If you are using Python scripting in Resolve v18, you might have to set Resolve to use Python 2.7 if the built-in API command "bmd.readstring()" is unable to convert a plain text formatted table into a Python dict. This is done in the "Fusion \> Fusion Settings..." menu item. Switch to the "Script" section on the left side of the view and then enable the "Default Python Version \> Python 2.7" option in the window.

![[img/image312.png]]

#### Bundled Scripts

### TouchDesigner Real-Time Immersive Workflows

TouchDesigner Real-Time Immersive Workflows

TouchDesigner is a node-based real-time visual creation environment.

TD's initial development roadmap branched off from its parent app, SideFX Prims/Houdini, in the early days of things but the program still shares many of the same paradigms, crazy acronyms, and ideas.

The commercial version of TD can be licensed using several methods including a CodeMeters based cloud-floating license, or a hardware USB dongle.

There is a free non-commercial edition of TD that you can get started with that is limited to 720p output but otherwise has all the other main features enabled for learning.

TD Links:

-   <https://derivative.ca/download>
-   <https://derivative.ca/learn>
-   <https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/TouchDesigner>

TouchDesigner is a good choice for building a custom node-based panoramic 360VR video stitching environment with support for multiple video input streams from capture hardware or IP network video streams. It supports depth sensors, a wide range of HID input devices, and VR HMDs.

### Real-Time Video Stitching with TouchDesigner + KartaVR + STMaps

Real-Time Video Stitching with TouchDesigner + KartaVR + STMaps

Building the STMap Warping Node-Graph in TD

![[img/image88.png]]

This video stitching approach works live and real-time in TouchDesigner. It uses a pre-made STmap template image to warp Canon R5C + RF 5.2mm dual fisheye imagery into a 180VR Side-by-Side layout.

This example requires you to have a custom STMap template image created beforehand which is a task KartaVR can help with. 😃

For more information about ST Maps check out the article:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQ-wc9ucLJqj-HL7iKMNWA71klV5O1fk2-JicRB6gDY/edit?usp=sharing>

Step 1. Create a new TouchDesigner project. Set the End/REnd frame range to the duration of the video footage you want to export. Customize the FPS parameter to 60 fps.

Step 2. Use a MovieFileIn node to load an STMap template image named "Media/EOS_R5C_RF52_STMap.0001.exr".

Step 3. Use a node to bring in the Canon R5C video footage.

You can import a pre-existing movie file from disk using a "MovieFileIn" node.

Or

You can import a live video feed into TouchDesigner with the help of either an NDI video stream, or a video capture card.

Step 4. Add a "Remap" node. Connect the Canon R5C footage and the STMap footage to the input connection on the Remap node.

Step 5. Add a MovieFileOut node and connect it to the Remap node. This is how the finished footage is exported from TouchDesigner.

Choose if you want to save out an image sequence or a movie file.

Then customize the File attribute to define the filename for rendered footage.

When you toggle on the "Record" button", the MovieFileOut footage will be written to disk. You can turn on the "Pause" button if you want to pause the export process.

It is a good idea to turn off the "\[x\] Realtime" checkbox at the top toolbar area in TouchDesigner if you are offline rendering a Movie file to disk and don't want to have any skipped frames.

Step 6. If you want you could enable pushing footage out to an HMD in real-time, or to an HDMI video output connection, or to a real-time internet video streaming platform with the "videostreamout" node.

Fusion Studio Based STMap Template Creation

STmap Creation.comp

![[img/image104.png]]

This example processes Canon EOS 180VR footage filmed with a Canon EOS R5C Camera Body and a Canon RF 5.2mm Dual Stereo Fisheye 190° Lens.

A CustomTool node was used to create the source ST Map default gradient pattern of a red and green gradient color.

Fusion's right-click in the node view \> Copy/Paste Instance contextual menu items were used to duplicate the RGB color warping nodes and make an instanced version of the nodes that automatically mirror those settings. This allowed us to swap out the RGB imagery and run an ST map warping template through in their place.

Then a Combiner node merged the left and right eye views' STMap warping templates into a side-by-side format.

The STMap warping template was then saved to disk as a single frame duration still image.

An STMap template needs to be saved in a high dynamic range format like a 16 bit or 32 bit per channel image format. The EXR image format makes a good output choice and you can use any 100% lossless image codec such as ZIP or None.

A ChangeDepth node was added just before the CustomTool to push the frame buffer to a floating-point high dynamic range format (32-bit float). This ensures we aren't working with a gradient image that is low-dynamic range for the rest of the comp.

STmap Rendering.comp

![[img/image89.png]]

This composite uses a pre-made STmap template image to warp Canon R5C + RF 5.2mm dual fisheye imagery into a 180VR Side-by-Side layout. The template was created with the help of the KartaVR WarpStitch fuse.

This example uses the STMapper fuse for warping the STmap template which is available in the Reactor Package Manager.

A stereo 3D preview of the scene is viewed with an anaglyph node and the kvrReframe360Ultra fuse which is available in the Reactor Package Manager.

### Resolve VR180 Warping via STMapperInline

Resolve VR180 Warping via STMapperInline

This approach works in the Resolve Studio Edit page. It uses a pre-made STmap template image to warp Canon R5C + RF 5.2mm dual fisheye imagery into a 180VR Side-by-Side layout.

This example requires you to have installed the STMapper fuse and the STMapperInline "Effects Template" macro which are available in the Reactor Package Manager.

For more information about ST Maps check out the article:

-   [KartaVR Workflows \| Creating ST Maps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQ-wc9ucLJqj-HL7iKMNWA71klV5O1fk2-JicRB6gDY/edit?usp=sharing)

Step 1. Create a new Resolve Studio project.

![[img/image385.png]]

Step 2. Edit the project settings.

![[img/image337.png]]

Set the Master Settings to use a Timeline format \> Timeline Resolution of 8192x4096 px processing.

Set the Timeline Format \> Playback frame rate to 59.94 frames per second.

Set the Image Scaling to use an Input Scaling \> Mismatched resolution files \> Stretch frame to all corners.

Set the Output Scaling to Mismatched resolution files \> Stretch frame to all corners.

![[img/image353.png]]

![[img/image331.png]]![[img/image191.png]]

Step 3. Add the movie file to the Resolve Media Pool. Create a new timeline based upon the clip.

In the "Create New Timeline" dialog uncheck "\[x\] Use Project Settings".

Switch to the Format tab and enable Timeline Resolution 8192 x 4096 processing.

Timeline Frame Rate 59.94 fps. Mismatched Resolution Stretch frame to all corners.

Step 4. In the Edit page, open the "Effects" tab at the top left of the user interface. Expand the "Toolbox \> Effects \> Stitching" section. Select the "STMapperInline" item and drag it onto the video clip in the Edit page timeline.

![[img/image325.png]]

Step 5. Expand the Edit page "Inspector" tab. Switch to the Effects section in the Inspector window. Select the STMapperInline item.

Click the "Browse" button and navigate on your hard disk to where this example project file is stored to select the STMap warping template image named: "STMap Canon R5C RF 5.2mm/Resolve Project/Media/EOS_R5C_RF52_STMap.0001.exr".

After a moment the Edit page preview window should show the results of the STMap warping the dual fisheye imagery into a side-by-side 180VR cropped 180x180° LatLong view layout.

Step 6. You can now edit the footage.

Step 7. The footage is then rendered via the Delivery page. If you are on a macOS system a good output format might be to use:

    Render Settings > Custom

    [x] Export Video

    Format: QuickTime
    Codec: Apple ProRes
    Type: Apple ProRes 422 HQ

    Resolution: Custom
    8192 x 4096 px

    Frame Rate: 59.94 fps

### PTGui Pro Batch Automated Workflows

PTGui Pro Batch Automated Workflows

PTGui Pro is the golden standard of panoramic 360VR stitching programs. For pipeline automation needs it has a powerful feature called batch-builder that lets you automate repetitive tasks like bulk stitching of HDRIs, or automatically stitch multi-view image sequences.

<https://ptgui.com/>

The Batch-Builder mode needs image sequences to be broken down into numbered folders for each timeline frame. Each folder holds all of the camera views for one specific frame number from the image sequences. Then a PTGui .pts file is copied into that folder.

![[img/image336.png]]

You can then use the Batch-Builder user interface in PTGui Pro to process this media.

Alternatively, you can control the PTGui command line task from a render manager like Deadline, or a toolset like Houdini TOPs, or a Fusion composite running Vonk Data Nodes.

#### PTGui Uses a JSON Based Project File Format

PTGui Uses a JSON Based Project File Format

A big change for PTGui v11-12+ project files is that they are stored in a JSON format. This means both the Notepad++ for Fusion atom package in the Reactor, and the Vonk JSON data nodes in Fusion can be used to interactively read every single attribute on the fly.

The KartaVR toolset includes two Lua-based automation scripts called "[PTGui BatchBuilder Creator](https://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#batch-builder-creator)" and "[PTGui BatchBuilder Extractor](https://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/scripts.html#batch-builder-extractor)" which can be used to bring multi-view media into and out of a numbered-folder hierarchy.

#### Using PTGui with Vonk Ultra

Using PTGui with Vonk Ultra

The Vonk Data Nodes also provide several example .comp files that show approaches for automating a PTGui workflow.

![[img/image361.png]]

### Virtual Production Cylinder Stitching Example

Virtual Production Cylinder Stitching Example

This KartaVP stitching example shows an interesting workflow that interactively stitches a PTGui Pro v12 .pts file inside of Fusion's node graph via a RunCommand node.

![[img/image140.jpg]]

Then Vonk JSON and Vonk Text data nodes work together to parse the JSON formatted .pts file to extract the relative file path location of the PTGui Pro v12 Batch rendered HDRI panoramic image.

![[img/image32.png]]

Finally, a simulated virtual production LED video stage wall is created using Fusion's 3D workspace. The latest PTGui Pro stitched imagery is automatically placed onto this LED video wall surface. A Camera3D node can then be flown around inside the virtual production stage filming volume to create reframed shots with the wrap-around live-action background plate visible.

![[img/image200.png]]

This sample footage was captured using a Nikon D750 Camera with an AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm F/2.8 ED lens. A Nodal Ninja panoramic head was adjusted to an indexed rotation value of 15 degrees per view rotation increment, and 12 view angles were captured in the Nikon RAW NEF image format starting at 1:30 AM, local time on 2021-12-08.

Each photo was HDR exposure blended from a set of three RAW images taken at +3EV, 0EV, and -3EV. The pictures had an average of a 30 second exposure time, ISO 1600, aperture F/8, and the content was captured using a manual exposure mode.

### SGO MistikaVR Stitching Workflows

SGO MistikaVR Stitching Workflows

SGO MistikaVR is a popular program for stitching 360VR videos with optical flow seaming. It supports the import of PTGui .pts project files for new camera rig template creation, and is capable of exporting STMaps that bake out the lens template setting used.

Mistika Boutique offers a wide range of online finishing features to expand on the 360VR stitching capabilities users get with MistikaVR. SGO also has a node-based video encoding and workflow automation tool that is appropriately called Mistika Workflows.

SGO Mistika is available on a subscription plan.

#### Distributed MVR Stitching Via a Render Farm

Distributed MVR Stitching Via a Render Farm

MistikaVR has command-line support which allows for external render manager based control and job distribution using programs like Amazon AWS Deadline.

This allows you to build a mini-render-cluster on a LAN network or in the cloud to speed up your immersive workflows when taking on ultra-high resolution stitching tasks of footage over 8K-16K+ resolution.

A MVR distributed rendering process becomes relevant if you start to create live-action captured backgrounds for virtual production LED video stage productions that need extreme image quality and lightning-fast turnaround times.

![[img/image221.png]]

You can use a combination of the "Submit MistikaVR Job to Deadline" controls for the "Pool", "Concurrent Tasks", "Machine Limit", and "Machine List" settings to hone the exact job distribution parameters to meet your GPU-powered render farm's precise hardware capabilities and scale.

The "Frames Per Task" control specifies how many frames are sent to an individual render node in a single job task. Setting a lower value might protect against memory leaks and GPU glitches from accumulating. Setting a higher value reduces the startup time overhead for launching a new MVR task.

### Resolve/Fusion HMD Connectivity

Resolve/Fusion HMD Connectivity

When you are running Resolve Studio (the Paid edition of Resolve) you can connect to an HMD inside the Fusion page compositing session environment. This is done by opening up the "Fusion \> Settings..." menu.

In Fusion Studio Standalone this settings change is done by opening the "Fusion Preferences" menu item.

![[img/image334.jpg]]

Then in the Fusion page settings window select the category on the left side of the window labelled "VR Headset". In this "VR Headset" section you can adjust the HMD settings to match your personal needs. With the HMD Support in the Resolve Fusion page, you can use Oculus SDK, and OpenVR based HMDs. The same approach works inside of Fusion Studio Standalone, too.

If you have an Oculus Quest HMD you can tether this HMD to Resolve's Fusion page as an output device by installing the Windows 10 based "Quest Link" drivers found on the Oculus website ([https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/meta-quest-link-compatibility/](https://support.oculus.com/444256562873335/?fbclid=IwAR058T1P5zQgtf-IPt8H6wYS_uJYArpw7jBhNEMcBHrapXjncPzwmoNePtw)). Then you connect a USB 3 class cable with a USB-C connector from your PC's USB 3 or 3.1 class USB port to the Quest HMD.

Personally speaking, I'm using a fairly long "Amazon Basics" USB-C cable and it works for my needs, although I wish it had a right angle connector on it like the Oculus Quest default charging cable has since I'm sometimes worried I might put stress on the Quest end of the cable when using room-scale 6DoF approaches with the HMD.

### KartaVR WarpStitch Ultra Fuse

KartaVR WarpStitch Ultra Fuse

WarpStitch is a hardware-accelerated DCTL fuse for Resolve/Fusion that allows you to warp and stitch fisheye imagery into an equirectangular/spherical/LatLong image projection panoramic video. Floating-point 16-bit per channel, and 32-bit per channel image processing is supported so you can work with bracket merged high dynamic range data and stitch the media into a spherical HDRI.

The DCTL support in WarpStitch allows the same fuse code to run equally well in a cross-platform fashion on Windows/Linux/macOS systems running across CUDA, OpenCL, and Metal GPU hardware.

WarpStitch Ultra was created by David Kohen (Learn Now FX), and Andrew Hazelden (KartaVR for Fusion). Development was made possible based upon code contributions from Chad Capeland's [CustomShader3D](https://indicated.com/download/3cus-sample-warping-fisheye-to-equirectangular-2/) project, and [DCTL code examples](https://github.com/baldavenger/DCTLs/blob/master/DCTL_OFX/DCTL_Functions.h) by BaldAvenger.

#### An Introduction to WarpStitch Ultra

An Introduction to WarpStitch Ultra

1\. Use a Loader or MediaIn node in Fusion to import footage that was filmed with a circular fisheye lens. Select this node.

2\. With the Nodes view active, press the "Shift + Space" hotkey to display the Select Tool dialog.

Type in "WarpStitch" and then press the "Add" button to insert a new KartaVR WarpStitch node into your composite. WarpStitch should now be connected to your Loader or MediaIn node.

3\. It is a good idea to insert an "AutoDomain" node into the composite immediately after a WarpStitch node, so Fusion will effortlessly handle the frame size and aspect ratio changes performed by WarpStitch. An AutoDomain node can be added using the "Shift + Space" hotkey to display the Select Tool dialog. Type in "AutoDomain" and then press the "Add" button.

4\. Select the WarpStitch node in your comp. In the Inspector window there is a "View Mode" ComboMenu control, which is at the top of the list of controls for the node.

The "View Mode" ComboMenu lets you switch between seeing the "Final Result", the "Original Image", or a variety of diagnostic modes like "Initial Crop", "Rotated Image", "Vector Mask", "Masked Image", "Warped Image", and "Color Corrected Image" which are useful for inspecting the intermediate stages of internal data processing performed by the WarpStitch node.

There are four tabs present that we need to interact with labeled "Lens", "Color", "Image", and "Settings".

The "Lens" tab provides the controls needed to adjust the warping process including: - Defining the lens center with the "Optical Frame Center" control - Modifying the original image's rotation is possible with the "Image Orientation \> Angle" control.

It allows you to choose between 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree rotations. - Applying vector masking to your imagery is done with the "Circular Fisheye Masking" / "Rectangular Masking" / "Split View Masking" controls - Adjusting the FOV for the circular fisheye lens is done with the "Diagonal Field of View" control.

A typical circular fisheye lens might have a 180 degree FOV. - Rotation of the spherical image projection output is done via the Rotate Sphere controls which provide access to rotating the warped image via a set of "Tilt", "Pan" and "Roll" controls. If you wanted to rotate a panoramic image horizontally by 180 degrees you would set the Pan control to 180.

The "Color" tab provides the controls needed to perform basic per-camera view color corrections to help your footage better match up when blended.

The Exposure, Gamma, Levels, and Output Levels controls allow you to adjust the overall brightness and contrast in the image along with the shadows and highlights.

The Saturation and Vibrance controls allow you to make the colors "pop" and appear more vivid. The White Balance section provides Color Temperature and Tint controls which allow you to compensate for per-camera differences in the color of the lighting.

The "Image" tab allows you to adjust the image aspect ratio settings for the final warped image. Additionally, the "Output ST Map" checkbox tells the WarpStitch node to output a "UV Pass" warping template image called an "ST Map" which can be used to store a pre-computed image projection transform into an image's red and green color channels. The "Edge Settings \> Edge" control can help fix seam artifacts.

The "Settings" tab allows you to assign your own intool scripting based "Frame Render Scripts", along with providing access to a pair of Edit Code buttons labeled "Edit Fuse" and "Reload Fuse" that can be used to manually tweak the default range of WarpStitch's user interface controls or to adjust any other aspect of the fuse's code.

5\. Switch back to the "Lens" tab.

Adjust the "Initial Crop \> Optical Frame Center" control to place the onscreen "X" shaped on-screen viewer control in the center of the circular fisheye image.

If you click in the Fusion viewer window so it has the user input focus, you can tap the TAB key several times to quickly toggle the active onscreen control widget so the "X" shaped on-screen viewer control is highlighted in red and can be dragged around visually with your cursor.

Note: If you are working with footage from a 1-piece panoramic camera that places both the front and back fisheye images inside the same image frame in a "SBS" side-by-side layout, you can typically start out by changing the "Optical Frame Center" value from "0.5" over to either "0.25" or "0.75" as an initial starting point before you would then refine the value further.

Change the "View Mode" to "Initial Crop".

The "Initial Crop \> Frame Border Padding" slider can be used to help "uncrop" a circular fisheye image that has been captured on a 16:9 video sensor that would cut off part of the circular fisheye image frame area.

If your camera body was rotated when mounted on the panoramic camera rig, you can adjust the "Image Orientation \> Angle" setting to correct for this view rotation. The "View Mode" control labeled "Rotated Image" lets you verify the image orientation adjustment is set as you'd expect so you can be sure you have the correct "upright" axis defined for the image before it is warped into a spherical image projection.

6\. Change the "View Mode" to "Masked Image" to see the circular masking applied to the imagery.

To adjust the circular fisheye masking setting, you can use the Inspector and drag the slider for the "Vector Masking \> Circular Fisheye Masking \> Mask Diameter" control to line up with the border of your fisheye lens image data, or the circular shaped onscreen control handle can be used to resize the mask visually.

The "Vector Masking \> Circular Fisheye Masking \> Mask Softness" slider allows you to adjust how hard or soft you want the mask edge to appear. Additionally, you could set the "View Mode" to "Vector Mask" to see just the black/white masking output if you want to see the precise size of the mask used and its overall softness.

7\. The "Warped Image \> Diagonal Field of View" control can be adjusted to change the FOV of the circular fisheye image. Typical wide angle fisheye lenses are somewhere in the range of 180 - 220 degree FOV.

You need to change the "View Mode" control to "Warped Image" or "Final Result" to see the effects of the FOV modifications. The Rotate Sphere controls for Tilt, Pan, and Roll are used to adjust the placement of the fisheye image inside the final spherical image projection.

8\. Switch to the Color tab. This tab allows you to perform "Quick 'n Dirty" modifications to each of the camera views you are processing. This is a time saver if you need to apply small color tweaks.

The "View Mode" control has a "Color Corrected Image" option that allows you to see the result of these changes. If you need to perform more complex color corrections you could always add a separate ColorCorrector node to the comp per-camera view.

Change the "View Mode" over to "Final Result" to see the effects of all the settings applied at once. This "Final Result" option is the setting WarpStitch should be left at when you are done with all your adjustments and want to look at the footage downstream in your composite.

9\. Repeat the main steps shown in sections 1-8 to set up each of the per-camera views you want to warp into a spherical image projection. For speed of adjustment consider using the copy/paste instance approach alongside the Deinstance controls tip to rapidly deploy many near identical camera views.

10\. Connect each of the WarpStitch per-camera view processed composite branches together using either a series of Merge nodes chained together, or with a kvrMergeLayers node that supports blending multiple image input connections that are fed into the same node simultaneously.

### KartaVR Reframe360 Ultra Fuse

KartaVR Reframe360 Ultra Fuse

A DCTL fuse that allows you to reframe your equirectangular/spherical/LatLong panoramic videos to create unique camera angles.

The code was ported by David Kohen (Learn Now FX), and Andrew Hazelden (KartaVR for Fusion) from the original open-source Reframe360 Resolve OpenFX plugin by Stefan Sietzen. Development was made possible based upon code contributions from the [DCTL code examples](https://github.com/baldavenger/DCTLs/blob/master/DCTL_OFX/DCTL_Functions.h) by BaldAvenger.

#### How to Solve a "Black Hole" Issue in Resolve

How to Solve a "Black Hole" Issue in Resolve

kvrReframe360 Ultra users have occasionally reported having a black circle region appear in the zenith and nadir zones of their panoramic video when reframing footage in the Resolve Edit/Fusion page. After working through the reports with the users, the following solution was found to be effective:

The issue is related to the source MP4 video file having a 2:1 aspect ratio, and their editing timeline was set to use a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1:1 aspect ratio for the output.

Resolve's default Timeline Settings will typically fit the panoramic footage to the frame size on one axis, and crop the footage on the other axis which creates the black hole artifact.

To fix the black region at the bottom of the frame issue, you should edit the Resolve Timeline settings.

In the Timeline Settings window, uncheck the "\[x\] Use Project Settings" checkbox. Then edit the "Mismatched Resolution" preference so it is set to "Stretch frame to all corners".

This will fit the source MP4 video so the width and height are scaled to precisely match the frame size of the rendered video.

The "Mismatched resolution files" setting can also be defined in the "Project Settings \> Image Scaling \> Input Scaling" preferences window, too.

### Resolve/Fusion 360VR Point Tracking

Resolve/Fusion 360VR Point Tracking

#### Applying 2D Tracking to LatLong 360VR based 3D Transforms

Applying 2D Tracking to LatLong 360VR based 3D Transforms

This post explains how to link a Tracker node to a Transform3D node. This allows you to track a 2D element in 360VR monoscopic footage with a stock Fusion Tracker node.

Step 1. Add a Tracker node to the comp, connect the Tracker node to your Loader/MediaIn based footage, and perform a 1-point track of an object in the frame. Refine the point tracking output using traditional Fusion tracking techniques, which can be found in other tutorials.

Step 2. Add your 3D element to the scene using either an FBX Mesh, ABC Mesh, or Fusion's geometry tools like a Shape3D node.

Step 3. Add a Transform3D node. Connect the geometry to the Transform3D node. Then select the Transform3D node.

![[img/image283.png]]

Step 4. Y-Axis Rotation Linking:

On the Y Rotation channel right-click and select the Connect To \> Tracker1 \> Offset X Position (3D Space).

![[img/image20.png]]

Then on the Y Rotation channel, right-click again and select "Insert \> Calculation: First Operand -\> Calculation".

![[img/image52.png]]

This will add a "Calculation on Transform3D" modifier to the node.

Click on the "Modifiers" tab on the Transform3D node to see the new modifier. The First Operand is linked to the tracker's X offset animation curve. Set the "Operator" to "Multiply". Then set the "Second Operand" to "-360".

![[img/image111.png]]

Tip: Alternatively, if you are working with 180VR footage you can set the "Second Operand" value to "-180".

Step 5. X-Axis Rotation Linking:

On the X Rotation channel right-click and select the Connect To \> Tracker1 \> Offset Y Position (3D Space).

Then on the X Rotation channel, right-click again and select "Insert \> Calculation: First Operand -\> Calculation".

This will add a "Calculation on Transform3D" modifier to the node.

Click on the "Modifiers" tab on the Transform3D node to see the new modifier. The First Operand is linked to the tracker's Y offset animation curve. Set the "Operator" to "Multiply". Then set the "Second Operand" to "180".

![[img/image222.png]]

#### Applying 2D Tracking to the PanoMap Node

Applying 2D Tracking to the PanoMap Node

It is also possible to apply this same type of approach to a PanoMap node's rotation controls.

![[img/image350.png]]

The PanoMap node's Rotation X and Rotation Y channels are what you would bind to the Tracker node in a similar fashion as a Transform3D node's rotation controls.

![[img/image319.png]]

The same modifier approach is then used to adapt the screen space 0-1 normalized coordinate system into a 360VR centric 360x180° coordinate system value range.

### Fusion/Kartaverse EXR Multi-Part vs Multi-Channel Workflows

Fusion/Kartaverse EXR Multi-Part vs Multi-Channel Workflows

This example shows two EXR image files that both contain 45 camera views along with an ST Map template. This is intended to be a demo of EXR Multi-Channel and Multi-Part usage.

The footage shows a green storm hurricane lantern that was rendered from V-Ray for Maya in a custom stereo camera rig that created 45 views in a linear camera array configuration. The camera filmback was altered so it created a uniform and consistent multi-view output that is "stereo converged" at the same zero parallax distance in the 3D scene.

For the purpose of this demo I grabbed pre-existing media from an existing GitHub project called [Lightfielder Suite](https://github.com/AndrewHazelden/LightfielderSuite).

#### EXR Sample Media Download Link

EXR Sample Media Download Link

To follow along on your local system, you can download the sample media here:

<https://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartaverse/downloads/exr_multipart_vs_multichannel.zip>

#### What is the Difference?

What is the Difference?

A "Part" in EXR image container terms can be thought of as a Photoshop layer. Each part in an EXR image can hold an arbitrary amount of image channels.

A "Channel" in EXR image container terms would be one greyscale channel of data like "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alpha", or "Z-Depth" data.

It is possible to hold multi-view data in an EXR container as either:

1 set of RGBA channels per EXR image like you are doing now.

Or multiple camera views (per-timeline-frame) can be packaged into a single EXR image for easier data portability with systems that can support multi-view or multi-part data I/O like the Resolve Fusion page, or NukeX, etc...

#### EXR Multi-Channel Data

EXR Multi-Channel Data

![[img/image197.png]]

The file "Media/Multi-Channel.0000.exr" stores each image from "Cam 01" to "Cam 45" as separate RGBA channels inside the same EXR image. This results in each camera view being accessed with the image data elements named like:

    Cam 01.A  
    Cam 01.R  
    Cam 01.G  
    Cam 01.B  
    ...  
    Cam 02.A  
    Cam 02.R  
    Cam 02.G  
    Cam 02.B  
    ...  
    Undistort STMap.A  
    Undistort STMap.R  
    Undistort STMap.G  
    Undistort STMap.B  

This is an example of a Fusion Loader node accessing the multi-channel components in the image:

![[img/image141.png]]![[img/image58.png]]![[img/image211.png]]

#### EXR Multi-Part Data

EXR Multi-Part Data

![[img/image292.png]]

The file "Media/Multi-Part.0000.exr" stores each image from "Cam 01" to "Cam 45" in separate image parts.

This results in each camera view being accessed by name. The individual RGB channels inside the EXR part are all consistently named "RGBA" with no prefix added.

    Part Name: Cam 01   
    Channels: RGBA  
    ...  
    Part Name: Cam 02  
    Channels: RGBA  
    ...  
    Part Name:  Undistort STMap  
    Channels: RGBA  

![[img/image67.png]]![[img/image307.png]]![[img/image36.png]]

#### Quilted Frame

Quilted Frame

![[img/image28.png]]

The image "Media/JPEGS/9x5_quilted_green_lantern.jpg" holds 45 views of imagery in a 5 horizontal x 9 vertical image grid layout.

This would sometimes be called a texture atlas, a quilted image, or a grid/tiled image layout. This media was originally prepared for playback on a Looking Glass Display.

#### Multi-View Image Sequences

Multi-View Image Sequences

![[img/image118.png]]

This approach is the plain-vanilla way to work with multi-view imagery, like you are already doing now. Each image stream from an individual camera on the multi-view camera rig is exported to a separate image sequence.

In this case a single timeline frame from the sample media was named like:

    "Media/JPEGs/Lantern.[0000-0044].0000.png"

### Fusion/Kartaverse Lightfield Workflows

Fusion/Kartaverse Lightfield Workflows

#### K Lens MultiView

K Lens MultiView

With the help of sample footage from a DPREVIEW article covering the German-made DSLR compatible "K Lens" light-field lens, several proof-of-concept light-field workflows were created in Resolve/Fusion/KartaVR.

The processing steps involved a "K Lens" light-field 3x3 camera view image extraction.

Then each of the 9 camera view positions were precisely aligned and registered against a common image feature. Finally, the output was repackaged back into a tiled grid layout. I used an expression on a Fusion "Text+" node to automatically label and number each camera view which allowed me to visually check and verify that the 3x3 grid layout based frame-packing order was correct.

![[img/image289.jpg]]

The imagery used for the proof-of-concept test was pulled from a December 8th, 2021 article by Damien Demolder on the DPREVIEW website titled:

[Hands-on with the K-Lens, a light field lens that captures 3D data for post-capture refocusing](https://www.dpreview.com/news/9729848884/hands-on-with-the-k-lens-a-light-field-lens-that-captures-3d-data-for-post-capture-refocusing)

Using this web-sourced image sample for an R&D test meant the footage was available at something like 1/10th of the original DSLR camera body's native photo resolution.

The native resolution for light-field media photographed with a DSLR + K Lens is calculated by breaking apart the 3x3 multi-view layout imagery. This is done as "Image Width ÷ 3", and "Image Height ÷ 3" for the final view size that is visible on a multi-view compatible playback device.

I don't think the lens resolution is an unworkable issue with the availability of image resizing options like PyTorch driven ML super-resolution techniques, or Topaz Labs software.

When a VFX artist carries out XR post-production, computational imaging techniques in Resolve/Fusion/KartaVR v5 allow "disparity mapping" and "Z-depth" to occur.

These approaches make it feasible to perform novel view synthesis tasks which generate interpolated views for playback on lenticular based light-field monitors like a "Looking Glass Display". In this case you can have up to 45 unique view angles rendered on screen at the same time using a method called "lenticular slicing".

Interestingly, it is worth noting that a "Lightfield Labs" display ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oGtgbsmmg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oGtgbsmmg8&fbclid=IwAR0kporpI5ojmSlo4z173qOOpioZhf2kJ2Mv3zutsPH4W0eGphb0exOMOgI)) can play 6DoF footage in glasses-free stereo 3D so the viewer experiences comfortable vertical and horizontal stereo parallax effects when changing the viewing position.

The elegance of having a single light-field lens mounted on a DSLR camera body is the type of innovation needed to support the production requirements of 6DoF live action filmmaking. Wider adoption of these 6DoF concepts will happen once end-to-end solutions exist for multi-view capture, along with affordable displays for multi-view glasses free media playback.

#### Looking Glass Multi-View

Looking Glass Multi-View

KartaVR includes several Looking Glass Display optimized macro nodes and example comps that support light-field image editing, Stereo 3D left/right eye image generation, and Fusion 3D workspace based multi-view rendering.

Check out the[LookingGlassRenderer3D macro](https://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartavr/docs/macros-guide-looking-glass.html#LookingGlassRenderer3D) docs for information about the node:

![[img/image279.png]]

#### Vonk vImageCreateTiles Node

Vonk vImageCreateTiles Node

The Vonk Data Node project provides a "vImageCreateTiles" fuse node that makes the creation of image grid layouts a node-based task.

This node makes it easy to create tiled "texture atlas" like grid layouts. If you need the imagery to be scaled down to a specific size, attach a resize or scale node to the image stream before you connect it to the vImageCreateTiles node.

The "Tiles X" control specifies how many images are stacked horizontally.

The "Tiles Y" control specifies how many images are stacked vertically.

The "Reverse X Order" and "Reverse Y Order" checkboxes are used to provide control over the image placement ordering when the grid layout is built. This allows you to start frame 1 at either of the 4 corners of the frame border.

### Fusion/Kartaverse Multi-View Parallel I/O Concepts

Fusion/Kartaverse Multi-View Parallel I/O Concepts

Pio (Parallel I/O) techniques in Fusion allow for more image channels/image streams to run through a Resolve/Fusion node graph than is normally possible in a controlled fashion.

Parallel I/O node graph construction approaches are different from most conventional stock workflows you would see for comp-based media management in a typical YouTube video, or in BMD's own user guides and manuals.

![[img/image125.jpg]]

An exciting aspect of Fusion-based multi-view comp creation is that data driven approaches can be used to automate and streamline media access through the use of open-source tools like the Vonk Data Nodes, and the ReadEXRUltra fuse.

#### Parallel I/O Example Comp Download

Parallel I/O Example Comp Download

This example shows a simplistic representation of multi-input and multi-output approaches applied in a Fusion composite.

[Parallel_IO_Workflow_Demo_1.zip](http://andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartaverse/downloads/Parallel_IO_Workflow_Demo_1.zip)

#### Parallel I/O Workflow Summary

Parallel I/O Workflow Summary

Parallel I/O provides a series of modular building blocks that will help accelerate the construction of densely packed multi-view node graphs. The primary use for this type of node assembly is for multi-view panoramic video stitching, for videogrammetry image based modeling, and for UDIM tile-based 3D texture map creation workflows.

This toolset was designed to assist artists who find themselves frequently assembling highly symmetrical layouts.

You can tell this is happening in your composite if you have a few "stacks" of very well-defined comp branches that travel the full length of the comp tree. These types of stacked multi-view branches in a comp will frequently use many synchronized settings that are mirrored across each view with the help of expression-linked attributes or instanced nodes.

Parallel I/O tools work by containerizing each of the individual processes that run concurrently across each of your individual multi-view data processing steps. This containerization process makes things easier to manage, and very consistent.

From the initial design stage, the Parallel I/O nodes encourage the use of super-nodal modifier nodes like the Vonk data node fuses. This allows for an "every datatype is a node connection away" philosophy.

#### What is this idea all about?

What is this idea all about?

My current multi-view data processing technique is done using an approach I call "Parallel I/O", "pI/O", or simply "pio" for short.

When working with all the normal nodes that come with Fusion, pI/O node graphs use multi-input and multi-output connections applied to your own "GroupOperator" based macro nodes. If you want you can place PipeRouters at the bottom of a pI/O node to provide a quick way to view image streams in a Fusion viewer window.

This grouped macro version of pI/O operates as a wrapper-like "container" for any type of node that could be found in Fusion Standalone or Resolve's Fusion page, including 3rd party OFX plugins, too.

This "pI/O" technique can be taken even further in custom DIY-created DCTL fuses, and it can be achieved with compiled FusionSDK based plugins, too. In these situations, you also get the benefit of new connection ports being added only as needed since you can go a bit deeper with the customization.

The Parallel I/O concept is effective for multi-view workflows as it allows you to take many, many, image streams and "trunk" them in parallel as the image data flows through the comp.

(Note: With this approach to parallel data trunking, it is very helpful to change the "Fusion Preferences \> Global and Default Settings \> Flow \> Build direction \>" setting to Vertical.)

My goal with this development effort was to allow Fusion to better compete with the near-unlimited EXR channel handling system present in other popular (and far less affordable) node-based compositing packages and to closer match the functional capabilities of the ubiquitous "Shuffle" node to be able to remap these extra image channels however you want to.

#### A Detailed Summary of the Parallel I/O Idea

A Detailed Summary of the Parallel I/O Idea

I see the Parallel I/O concept as an excellent way to be able to assign the same image processing settings in bulk, and to have those values transparently kept in sync across each of the individual image streams passing through the node.

This all happens via the magical wonder of Fusion's Right-Click contextual menu-based "Copy" (Command + C) entry, and the matching "Paste Instance" (Shift + Command + V) menu entry being used on most of the nodes that are packaged inside a "pI/O" wrapper based GroupOperator (aka Group node) shell.

This technique can be done even better when applied to your own fuse-based tools that use the dynamic input connection creation code that originated in the classic Eyeon Software era "Switch.fuse" example that was created by Stefan Ihringer (aka CompFu) all the way back in 2010. This fuse node-based approach makes it so the extra "pI/O" connection ports are created as needed, on the fly, as you connect and disconnect imagery from the Parallel I/O nodes in the Nodes view. Very cool stuff and a nice quality of life improvement.

With these Parallel I/O based multi-view techniques applied in Resolve/Fusion, you can quickly add your own synchronized LUT nodes, cropping, transforming, image projection changes, stabilization, 2D filters, or any other thing you might want to do individually to each image stream that is coming from a multi-view camera array and passing through your composite.

IMHO, this concept perfectly lines up with the needs of immersive artists who regularly work on multi-view, stereo 3D, 3603D VR, lightfield, or video/photogrammetry workflows.

#### Streamlining the Footage Loading and Saving Process

Streamlining the Footage Loading and Saving Process

I am currently working on a simpler approach for media management in Fusion by allowing the use of filename tokens in the "Filename" field of Multi-view based Loader/Saver node remakes. These node remakes are being created as fuse nodes (which work in Resolve (free), Resolve Studio, and Fusion Studio Standalone).

The use of multi-input/multi-output fuses for media access works by leveraging the Fusion native Fuse API PutFrame/GetFrame/EXRIO functions which are accessible from the Vonk "vImage" fuses, the "pioSaver" fuse, and the "LifeSaver" fuse.

The end result of all this deeply technical discussion is that these new KartaVR v5 centric approaches allow an artist, in only a few clicks, to bulk-load a "metric ton" of multi-view footage into a Fusion composite on the fly, which makes it possible to do just about anything to the content in post-production.

You can then render this multi-view media out via a Fusion GUI session, the Delivery Page, or distribute the task on a render farm or a cloud compute cluster via the unlimited render node license capability of the Fusion Render Node app. Very sweet stuff indeed.

Getting creative as a compositor, and combining pI/O techniques for node building, along with the magical Vonk Fuses, would allow you to dramatically re-define how all of your multi-view imagery is loaded into each image stream in the comp session. Additionally, the media I/O tasks could all be made to happen in a fashion that can be controlled 100% by external data sources that live outside a .comp file such as JSON, XML, YAML, CSV (comma-separated value), TSV (tab-separated value), or IFL files (image file lists).

With pI/O (and the Vonk fuse) at play, you'd even have the option to pull data into the composite that is stored externally on your local LAN network or the full open interweb via Fusion's LuaJIT FFI scripting bindings that offer built-in cURL based internet socket connections. Adding nodes constructed with live network connectivity to a flow is achieved with a small adaptation of the existing Vonk "vImageFromNet", "vJSONFromNet", or "vTextFromNet" nodes.

To make this Parallel I/O process faster to use in real-world immersive compositing workflows, I am looking into ways to script and automate the pI/O tools so an artist could select any two compatible nodes in the Nodes views, and do automatic multi-input and multi-output connection wiring in an instant via .fu based hotkey bindings, or with a right-click in the flow "tool" script contextual menu item entry.

#### MultiChannel EXR Exporting pioSaver Node

MultiChannel EXR Exporting pioSaver Node

pioSaver is a fuse based replacement for the traditional Saver node. It is available in the Reactor Package Manager.

This fuse uses EXRIO for the file output and supports multi-channel EXR data export. This node is special in that you can use it in comps that are created inside of Resolve's Fusion page and inside of Fusion Standalone.

In this example comp, the Vonk "vTextCreate" fuse node is used to externally supply the base "filename prefix" text string record used for the pioSaver powered EXRIO image saving node. This filename-prefix is added using the token value of "`${COMP}/${NODE}/${NODE}`".

The Vonk "vTextSubFormat" fuse node is used to add the relative PathMap for the current comp's Render folder, along with the frame padding information, and the image extension using the string "`Comp:/Render/{1}.0000.exr`"

### Fusion Native Lens Distortion Correction

Fusion Native Lens Distortion Correction

Although it is preferable to be able to exclusively use Panotools/Hugin/PTGui style A/B/C lens distortion parameters in your 360VR workflows...

The built-into Fusion LensDistort node has existed for ages and it allows you to access the lens distortion/undistortion math that is used in the 3D Equalizer camera match-moving/tracking software which is a tool that comes from the feature film VFX industry. The Fusion LensDistort node's "3DE Radial - Fisheye, Degree 8, Release 1" lens distortion model can be used to linearize the f-theta distortion that is present in your 360VR camera rig's original unstitched circular fisheye lens shot media.

![[img/image277.jpg]]

This corrective lens warping action will give your footage a lens distortion effect that more closely resembles an "angular fisheye" lens model, which is often called a "Domemaster" style of image in the 180 degree diagonal FOV (Field of View) planetarium show production space.

The Lens Distortion correction process results in footage that is very consistent and uniform. The resulting media is much easier to apply DIY, artist-driven, 100% manual, node-based stitching techniques to.

Most people don't realize they can use the Fusion LensDistort node in their composites, with no external tool requirement, as long as you don't mind taking some time with test footage to eye-ball the warping effect to taste, for each of the lenses you work with in your 360VR content creation process. With a little practice, this approach will often work well enough for a quick-n-dirty lens correction that is done 100% inside of a stock copy of Fusion or Resolve's Fusion page.

Alternatively, you could explore ST Map (UV pass) warping to apply pre-computed lens correction values sourced from an ST Map template image that you would create externally. Yes, in the long term, solutions for applying Panotools style A/B/C corrections are preferred... but if you want to get work done today, this post should get you going in a positive direction.

### Fusion Stereo 3D 360VR View Rotation Effects

Fusion Stereo 3D 360VR View Rotation Effects

An important distinction in 360VR post-production is the difference between the idea of levelling a panorama with XYZ rotations (pan/tilt/roll) vs what a reframed video output offers.

If your goal is to level a 360VR video clip, and you want your final output to still be a 360°x180° spherical clip that you can view on an HMD, you should explore the use of the Fusion built-in PanoMap node to apply the view rotation effect.

After you do the view rotation via the PanoMap node, you can render out the footage to a 2:1 aspect ratio movie file, and then use a tool like the Spatial Media Metadata Injector to make this footage play back correctly on YouTube 360 or in a VR movie player like VLC or GoProPlayer.

If you need to level/rotate a Top/Bottom 360VR stereo video, you can use a combination of the Splitter node (Split: Vert), two PanoMap nodes (with the 2nd node added via Copy/Paste Instance (Ctrl + Shift + V hotkey), and then finally a Combiner node (Combine: Vert) at the end.

![[img/image252.jpg]]

The Splitter node lets you separate the left and right eyes apart from the TopBottom original footage. The two PanoMap nodes apply your view rotations. Finally, the Combiner node allows you to merge the two separate left and right eye image streams back together into a single TopBottom formatted 360VR output.

A reframing effect, by comparison, acts as its own version of an offline-rendered panoramic movie viewer. The reframing process that the Reframe360 Ultra node does converts a 360VR movie into a "flat" output, which is also called a rectilinear image projection in tools like PTGui. The reframing process takes a spherical 360° panorama and makes it suitable for viewing on a conventional monitor without any VR gear, or for posting on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter where there is no native VR playback support.

A reframed video conversion is also great if you are looking to get a "Tiny Planet" like output from your spherically shot 360°x180° source footage.

![[img/image14.jpg]]

### Resolve Edit Page PanoMap Effects Templates

Resolve Edit Page PanoMap Effects Templates

Here are two Resolve Studio Edit page compatible "Effects Template" versions of the built-in Fusion PanoMap node that might be of use for 360VR video editors.

One macro node is named "**PanoMapMono**" for monoscopic 360° video usage.

The other macro node is named "**PanoMapStereo**". The node allows you to work in the Edit page and apply view rotations to stereoscopic 3D Top/Bottom and Side-by-Side formatted 360° video content. This macro has integrated Splitter/Combiner nodes that are expression linked.

![[img/image194.jpg]]

To use the two effects template files:

Step 1. Download the attached "PanoMapMono.setting.txt" and "PanoMapStereo.setting.txt" files and remove the .txt extension from the end of the filenames.

**Macro Download Links**:

[PanoMapMono.setting.txt](https://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartaverse/downloads/PanoMapMono.setting.txt?fbclid=IwAR34BbWNJ7MGGbFFkrfSvDYcEd-LtkUmFRF6A4aF5U2YEslufOHJkgTGsxU)

[PanoMapStereo.setting.txt](https://www.andrewhazelden.com/projects/kartaverse/downloads/PanoMapStereo.setting.txt?fbclid=IwAR3sBGTMXh9b39n5mG8uJZfro7iDB-OMLhyY_xNJCccdkixd5XwO_e7yY5M)

Step 2. Create a new "VR'' subfolder inside your Resolve Edit page based Templates folder. You will have to manually create the multiple intermediate subfolders to do this:

**Windows**:

    C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Templates\Edit\Effects\VR\

**macOS**:

    /Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Templates/Edit/Effects/VR/

**Linux**:

    /var/BlackmagicDesign/DaVinci Resolve/Support/Fusion/Fusion/Templates/Edit/Effects/VR/

Step 3. Copy the Effects Template files into the new "VR" folder created in Step 2.

Step 4. Restart Resolve. Switch to an Edit page timeline with VR footage in it. In the Effects Library Tab navigate to the "Toolbox \> Effects" view.

Step 5. Drag a "PanoMap" or "PanoMapStereo" macro onto a clip in the timeline.

Step 6. Select the 360VR video clip in your timeline, then open the Inspector view and select the "Effects" control page/tab. The PanoMap node's controls will be accessible and editable.

For the PanoMapStereo macro node, the "Split: Vert" control is used for "Top/Bottom Stereo" footage. The "Split: Horiz" control is used for "Side-by-Side Stereo" footage.

### Mobius Transformations

Mobius Transformations

Möbius transformations make it possible to apply zoom, rotation, and translation effects to immersive 360VR footage. With Möbius operations, the input and output media will maintain their original 360°x180° degree spherical image projection. This allows you to transform the footage and still be able to view the media on a VR HMD afterwards.

<https://github.com/AndrewHazelden/mobius>

This is a spherical image before a mobius zoom is applied:

![[img/image25.jpg]]

The next image shows the same scene with a mobius zoom effect used to pull the camera upwards, away from the nadir zone at the bottom of the panorama:

![[img/image230.jpg]]

When the mobius transformed media is displayed in a panoramic image viewer you will see what looks vaguely like a tiny planet result but the media input is still 360°x180° content which allows you to freely look around the scene with a VR HMD on.

Note: A mobius transform approach is distinctly different from the results you get with traditional "overcapture" 360VR reframing processes that will translate a source 360°x180° degree spherical image projection into either a traditional rectilinear "flat" image projection with a \~90° FOV (Field of View) output, or a stereographic "tiny planet" flattened image projection.

### Resolve/Fusion LatLong Patcher Node

Resolve/Fusion LatLong Patcher Node

The Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio native "LatLong Patcher" tool, when operating in the "Apply" mode, takes a 90° FOV CubeMap face image as the input. The cubic view is connected to the "yellow" input triangle on the node.

That 90° FOV cubic view image is then warped into a LatLong image projection.

![[img/image309.jpg]]

The source image fed into a "LatLong Patcher" node, (*when this patcher tool is set to the "Apply" Mode*), is typically a "MediaIn" or "Loader" node that has a 1:1 aspect ratio. This imagery should be as close as possible to an idealized 90° FOV (*Field of View*) that corresponds to the "front" face of a cubic panoramic frame format. You can use a crop node to reformat a larger, or wider aspect ratio down to the correct 1:1 ratio that is required.

The "LatLong Patcher" node's "XYZ Rotation" controls allow you to adjust the placement of the converted image by shifting the Yaw/Pitch/Roll.

Tech Note: The animated rotation effect generated by this node, (*even when the Motion blur setting is active in the composite*), will not typically have motion-blur applied if you keyframe animate the XYZ rotation channels.

For motion-blurred 360VR output, look at a true Fusion 3D workspace based image projection conversion, that is then rendered to disk using a "Renderer3D" node.

This is typically generated using a "Spherical Camera" node that is connected upstream of the "Renderer3D" node, inside the Fusion 3D scene graph you build.

### Resolve/Fusion 360VR Inertial Stabilization Workflows With Gyroflow

Resolve/Fusion 360VR Inertial Stabilization Workflows With Gyroflow

#### Command-Line Based Shell Script

Command-Line Based Shell Script

"[Gyroflow to CSV](https://github.com/EmberLightVFX/Gyroflow-to-CSV)" is a Python script that converts your [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz/) stabilization to a CSV file.

When using the CLI based Gyroflow to CSV script, make sure to choose "including processed gyro data" when exporting from Gyroflow. By default, Gyroflow saves out the rotation data using a [Euler rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) (ZYX) based notation format. It also saves out the data in your footages' native frame rate.

#### Fusion Based Comp Script

Fusion Based Comp Script

[Gyroflow Fusion](https://github.com/EmberLightVFX/Gyroflow-to-CSV/tree/main/Atoms/com.JacobDanell.GyroflowFusion) is a Python-based comp script with a custom UI Manager based GUI that runs inside of the Fusion page, and in Fusion Studio.

Script Requirements:

-   Resolve (free) or Resolve Studio or Fusion Studio
-   Python 3.6+ is required to use this script.

#### DragDrop Support

DragDrop Support

The Gyroflow Fusion toolset supports drag and drop handling of .gyroflow files. This works by dragging the file from an Explorer/Finder/Nautilus desktop folder browsing location and dropping the file into the Fusion nodes view area.

In this situation, the Gyro Fusion script is automatically launched and the "Gyroflow Filename" textfield is pre-filled in advance in the GUI.

#### Using the Script

Using the Script

To run the script, open the Fusion Studio based "Script \> Gyroflow Fusion \> Gyroflow to CSV" Menu item.

![[img/image237.png]]

#### Splash Screen

Splash Screen

A splash screen is shown that provides usage information about the required Gyroflow export settings.

"The script converts your Gyroflow stabilization to a CSV file. Make sure to choose"including processed gyro data" when exporting from Gyroflow. As default it saves out the rotations as Euler rotation (ZYX). It also saves out the data in your footages' native frame rate."

Click the "Continue" button to proceed.

Note: If you want to go to the Gyroflow website you can click on the logo image at the top of the dialog.

![[img/image299.png]]

#### File Dialog

File Dialog

This dialog is used to define the parameters used when the Gyroflow document is exported to a CSV file. In the "Gyroflow Filename" field select a file with the ".gyroflow" file extension.

Click the "Go" button to proceed.

![[img/image264.png]]

If you enabled the '\[x\] Add "Gyroflow CSV" Nodes to Comp' checkbox in the dialog, a Vonk node graph is inserted into your Fusion composite that has the path to the Gyroflow generated CSV file pre-entered into the "vTextFromFile" node's "Input" textfield.

The nodes named "xGyro1", "yGyro1", and "zGyro1" provide the Number data-type based outputs for the Rotate X/Y/Z channels of IMU (inertial) stabilization data from Gyroflow.

![[img/image239.png]]

If you have a large Gyroflow file that takes a while to process, you can watch the progress status in the Console window. Clicking the Console button on the top left of the Fusion interface, or pressing the "Shift + 0" hotkey is a quick way to open the Console window.

![[img/image274.png]]

#### Macro

Macro

A "Gyroflow CSV" macro is available in the "Select Tool" dialog. This macro makes it quick and painless to quickly add the supporting Vonk nodes to the node-graph.

![[img/image281.png]]

The nodes named "xGyro1", "yGyro1", and "zGyro1" provide the Number data-type based outputs for the Rotate X/Y/Z channels of IMU (inertial) stabilization data from Gyroflow.

![[img/image239.png]]

#### Example Fusion Comp

Example Fusion Comp

A Gyroflow example compositing project is provided that includes a short video clip, a .gyroflow file, and a CSV export. This project shows an applied use of the "Gyroflow to CSV" script and [Vonk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9WfdHlE1AZHdU6_ZQCB1I2nSa5I7TyHG2vKMi2I7v8/edit?usp=sharing) data nodes inside of Fusion.

In order to use this example comp you need to have Vonk installed (from the Reactor Package Manager) to read a Gyroflow CSV file and drive a 3D camera with it.

Open the example project if you want to see how it's done:

    Reactor:/Deploy/Comp/Gyroflow Fusion/Gyroflow.comp

![[img/image128.png]]

#### Gyroflow Node Connections

Gyroflow Node Connections

You can connect these nodes to your Fusion 3D workspace based Camera3D or Transform3D node's Rotation channels.

![[img/image383.png]]

Right-clicking on either of the X/Y/Z channel keyframe "diamond shapes" in the Inspector view provides access to the "Connect To" contextual menu entry.

![[img/image149.png]]

The mapping of Gyroflow channels is:

    xGyro1.Output -> Transform3DOp.Rotate.X
    yGyro1.Output -> Transform3DOp.Rotate.Y
    zGyro1.Output -> Transform3DOp.Rotate.Z

#### Timeline Render Start Frame

Timeline Render Start Frame

The "vNumberAdd" node is used to shift the starting frame number when accessing the CSV (comma separated value) text file's "Index" based line number. By default the offset of adding 1 to the current timeline frame number is entered so things work out of the box with a timeline that has frame 0 as the "Render Start" frame value.

You can easily modify the vNumberAdd node's "Term 2" setting to line up with your VFX workflow needs such as a shot with a frame 1, frame 1000, or frame 1001 "Render Start" frame.

![[img/image372.png]]

#### IMU Motion Corrections

IMU Motion Corrections

If you need to adjust the direction axis for the IMU corrections, there are two preset values stored in the "Versions" controls for the "xGyro1", "yGyro1", and "zGyro1" nodes.

This applies a "1" or "-1" multiplication operation to the rotation channel data using a Vonk "vNumberMultiply" node's built-in "Factor2" control.

![[img/image175.png]]

#### 360VR Rotation Correction

360VR Rotation Correction

If your footage was filmed on a 360VR spherical camera that records internal IMU data, it is possible to apply the Gyroflow corrections to a Resolve/Fusion built-in "PanoMap" node instead of using a Camera3D or Transform node.

In this case the mapping of Gyroflow channels is:

    xGyro1.Output -> Rotate.X
    yGyro1.Output -> Rotate.Y
    zGyro1.Output -> Rotate.Z

#### Monoscopic 360VR

Monoscopic 360VR

You would connect your source 360VR footage to a Loader/MediaIn node. Then connect the image output to the PanoMap node:

    Loader -> PanoMap

or

    MediaIn -> PanoMap

![[img/image164.png]]

#### Stereoscopic 3D 360VR

Stereoscopic 3D 360VR

If you are working with Side-by-Side or Over/Under formatted stereo 3D footage, you would need to split apart the left and right eye views with Fusion's built-in "Splitter" node.

The PanoMap node is used to apply the view rotation corrections. When adding PanoMap nodes to the comp, the use of the "Copy" and "Paste Instance" commands can be a timesaver as it will keep the left and right eye view node attributes synced up in the Inspector tab.

Finally, the Fusion built-in Combiner node is used to merge the left and right eye views back together again into a single stereoscopic 3D image.

The node connections are:

    Loader/MediaIn -> Splitter

    Splitter.Image1 (Left) -> PanoMap (Left)
    Splitter.Image2 (Right) -> PanoMap (Right)

    PanoMap (Left) -> Combiner.Image1
    PanoMap (Right) -> Combiner.Image2

    Combiner -> Saver/MediaOut

#### 360VR Overcapture / Reframing

360VR Overcapture / Reframing

You could also use Gyroflow X/Y/Z view rotation data to help drive the KartaVR Reframe360 node's output. The Gyroflow data would be connected to the kvrReframe360Ultra node's View Transforms \> "Pitch", "Yaw", "Roll" attributes.

This allows the IMU data to be used for the primary view leveling (or motion dampening) effect. This would be followed by a Vonk vNumberMultiply / vNumberAdd node approach to blend in artist controlled keyframable view offset adjustments that are animated across the timeline frame range.

Averaging / motion dampening can be applied using Vonk based temporal effects on Number datatypes. This makes it possible to read frame values ahead/behind the current playhead/timeline frame number (vNumberCompReqTime).

## Apple Compressor Command-Line Syntax

Apple Compressor Command-Line Syntax

Apple's Compressor program supports command line job submission. This allows for high-quality ProRes 4444XQ video encodes to be done in an automated fashion on a tiny video encoding system like a macMini that could be placed in the corner of a machine room.

Compressor Learning Resources:

-   [Apple \| Compressor](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/compressor/)
-   [Apple \| Compressor 4 \| Shell Commands for Submitting Compressor Jobs](https://help.apple.com/compressor/mac/4.0/en/compressor/usermanual/index.html#chapter=C%26section=1%26tasks=true)

### Image Sequence to Movie Encoding

Image Sequence to Movie Encoding

Almost every macOS based visual effects artist has a copy of Apple Final Cut Pro on their system, along with the Apple Compressor program, regardless of how often they use it.

What you might not have noticed is that Apple Compressor can be used as a standalone tool for batch converting image sequences, like OpenEXR RGBA footage, into a standards compliant ProRes movie output.

When doing the encoding task a key detail is that you need to place one image sequence per folder on your hard disk. Additionally, just to state this one more time since it is important, only have a single image sequence "clip" in that folder so Compressor doesn't get distracted!

Also it is a good idea to start the image sequence at frame 0000.

To encode an image sequence into a movie, start up the Compressor program. Then select the "File \> Add Image Sequence..." menu item.

![[img/image106.png]]

You can then adjust the encoding parameters for the current batch job.

If you are doing this operation very often it makes sense to carry along to the next part of this process and automate the task fully with the help of Compressor's command-line interface.

### Compressor Command-Line Usage

Compressor Command-Line Usage

macOS ZSH Shell Syntax:

    "/Applications/Compressor.app/Contents/MacOS/Compressor" -batchname "ProRes Encode" -jobpath "$Home/Desktop/ImageSequence/" -settingpath "Reactor:/Deploy/Bin/compressor/settings/ProRes.cmprstng" -locationpath "$Home/Desktop/ProRes_Encode.mov"

Note: The "`.cmprsrng`" file format is a Compressor exported encoding preset settings file.

The Omniverse toolset has been humorously described by end users as vaguely reminiscent of the entrepreneurial business model that existed in the Klondike era with the "pick and shovel" gear manufacturers.

The meaning here is that Omniverse is a tool that exists to serve a specific utilitarian purpose --- to help the end user get work done fast and efficiently.

The Omniverse end customer is then going off to use the pick and shovel tools they bought on large scale undertakings, to stake their gold claim, and do something big and impactful.

### Virtual Production Lens Metadata

Virtual Production Lens Metadata

A key aspect of virtual production is to have cine lenses that support the passing of lens metadata.

#### Cooke Optics

Cooke Optics

Cooke Optics cinema lenses use the /i technology lens metadata protocol to store important lens information. The /i technology lens data is passed through a PL mount lens connector to the cinema camera body.

This is a YAML based metadata encoding format that holds 4D time-based data for the lens parameters that is accurately synced to the current video frame. Also having the unique lens serial number record can be helpful in post-production as it provides artists with access to the original Cooke Optics factory lens calibration information which is useful when working with anamorphic lenses that have extensive lens breathing.

Blackmagic Design URSA 12K camera bodies for example, are able to store the /i technology metadata in native BRAW format media.

## Fulldome

Fulldome

Fulldome is the term often associated with video-based planetarium style hemispherical "dome" theaters.

![[img/image166.jpg]]

A fulldome theater typically plays 180° angular fisheye content that is stored in a media file called a "domemaster" image projection. It is also possible to use cubic or LatLong/Spherical/Equirectangular image projection footage in a dome theatre.

Rectilinear image projection content can be warped and stretched to fill a fulldome screen as well.

Affordable portable domes can be inflated on-site, or built with module geodesic construction approaches. Portable domes often use a half-spherical mirror based projection approach that can be played back with a warp-mesh control file.

## Installing a Local Content Staging Web Server

Installing a Local Content Staging Web Server

A local content staging server allows you to create new revisions to a website without breaking the existing live website.

If you want to work with large media files and develop content that will eventually be played back from a web server it is very important to do extensive local testing with a copy of your website content and web server tools.

Spending a lot of time to upload and then re-download web site content over-and-over again during your ongoing development and testing phases is often time wasted.

### Installing MAMP on macOS and Windows

Installing MAMP on macOS and Windows

If you are using macOS or Windows the easiest web sharing module to set up and install is MAMP. For local testing the MAMP program is likely all you need and you can skip running MAMP Pro.

No discussion of web sharing programs would be complete without a brief suggestion that you talk with your system administrator about network security and firewalls before enabling an Apache web sharing mode on your system. You may also want to research Apache .htaccess files to learn how to lock down the htdocs sharing folder to only allow access from users with a specific realm login account and password.

Step 1. Start by downloading and installing MAMP.

On Windows MAMP is installed on your hard disk at:

    C:\MAMP\MAMP.exe

On macOS MAMP is installed on your hard disk at:

    /Applications/MAMP/MAMP.app

Step 2. Launch MAMP for the first time. An easy to use GUI will appear.

![[img/image206.png]]

On the right side of the MAMP window is a button with a circular "power" icon that lets you Start and Stop the MAMP server. Click the Start Servers button if the MAMP server is not running yet.

On the left side of the MAMP window is a "Preferences" button that will open up the Apache server controls. Click the Preferences button.

Step 3. The Preferences window allows you to control the Apache server settings without having to manually edit any configuration files.

Enable the "Start Servers when starting MAMP" and "Stop Servers when quitting MAMP" checkboxes in the Start/Stop tab.

Turning on these two controls means you can easily use MAMP when you want to view locally served html content. Then when you have finished with that task you can quit the MAMP GUI, and MAMP will then immediately stop the Apache web sharing background system service.

![[img/image105.png]]

There are several other settings in the MAMP preferences window you could adjust if you wanted to.

Step 4. Click on the Ports tab in the MAMP preferences window. The Ports tab allows you to change the default server port settings for the Apache web sharing.

![[img/image305.png]]

On Windows the Apache Port is set to 80 by default. This is the typical port used for all HTTP based web servers. The MAMP localhost address for your Windows system would be: http://localhost/

On macOS the Apache Port is set to 8888 by default to avoid conflicts with the macOS built-in web sharing modes. In your web browser a custom port is defined in the URL by typing a colon and then the port number like ":8888" after the website server address.

The MAMP localhost address for your macOS system would be: <http://localhost:8888/>

Step 5. Click on the Web Server tab in the MAMP preferences window.

This tab allows you to change the "Document Root" folder that is shared by the Apache server module. By default this "Document Root" directory path is set to the "htdocs" directory in the MAMP program folder.

![[img/image370.png]]

Unless you have a very specific technical reason to adjust the "Document Root" setting in MAMP it is a good idea to leave this text field at the default value in the MAMP preferences dialog.

### Setting up Apache httpd on Linux

Setting up Apache httpd on Linux

If you are going to be using KartaVR automation scripts on Linux you will also need to install the clipboard tool xclip, along with the Apache (httpd) server modules for web sharing:

    yum install xclip httpd

You can start Apache (httpd) using:

    systemctl start httpd.service
    systemctl enable httpd.service

On CentOS if you want to make the Apache HTTP port 80 accessible external to the machine you can open that port up on the firewall rules:

    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
    firewall-cmd --reload

On Linux the Apache Port is set to 80 by default. This is the typical port used for all HTTP based web servers. If you need to use an alternative port address you could choose 8080.

The HTTPD (HTTP Daemon) web server's localhost address for your Linux system would be:

    http://localhost/

The Apache "Document Root" path is the /var/www/html/ directory. This is where the KartaVR scripts will save the VR webpage preview exports.

Note: You will have to make the "/var/www/html/" folder writable for the users that are running the KartaVR VR preview script. You can either use chmod to change the folder permissions to do this, or you can use chown to add the user to a group with write permissions. The various Apache setup guides on the internet can provide details on this step.

### Installing SSHPass

Installing SSHPass

SSHPass is a command-line utility that dramatically simplifies the process of allowing a shell script to make remote SSH based calls to render nodes.

<https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ssh-automation-sshpass>

This toolset is something that should only be used inside of a trusted closed LAN network environment, where you are comfortable and have full awareness of the SSH security implications and network access policies. Do not use this tool if you are in a low-trust environment.

Install SSHPass on macOS:

    curl -O -L http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/sshpass/sshpass/1.05/sshpass-1.05.tar.gz && tar xvzf sshpass-1.05.tar.gz
    cd sshpass-1.05
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Install SSHPass on LINUX:

    yum --enablerepo=epel -y install sshpass

#### SSHPass Install Location

SSHPass Install Location

By default SSHPass is installed to one of the following installation locations.

macOS SSHPass Install Path:

    /usr/local/bin/sshpass

CentOS Linux SSHPass Install Path:

    /usr/local/bin/sshpass

Ubuntu Linux SSHPass Install Path:

    usr/bin/sshpass

#### Using SSHPass

Using SSHPass

Here is an SSHPass shell scripting example that uses ffmpeg to carry out a macOS video capture device based framegrab over an SSH network connection.

This code snippet assumes an environment variable named "SSHPASS_DIR" exists that defines the sshpass installation location. It also uses the macOS based AVFoundation library to grab an image from a webcam named "Cisco VTCamera3".

    echo "[Linux] Network Framegrab"
    # Note on macOS the ssh -n -t -t flag helps with redirecting the output for tty password submission

    "$SSHPASS_DIR" -p 'correcthorsebatterystaple' ssh -n -t -t vfx@10.20.30.1  'opt/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg -y -f avfoundation -framerate 5.000000 -video_size 1600x1200 -pixel_format uyvy422 -vsync 2 -i "Cisco VTCamera3" -f image2 -vcodec mjpeg -vframes 1 -qscale:v 2 /Volumes/Media/screenshot.jpg'

### Installing Zenity / Dialog

Installing Zenity / Dialog

Zenity or Dialog are excellent choices for GUI toolkits if you need to create a quick and efficient user interface for a shell script that is run purely from a text-based terminal session or a remote SSH based session.

<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity>

If you have used the "dialog" GUI toolkit in the past to create text-based interfaces, you will find Zenity is very natural to pick up and use as well.

macOS Homebrew install:

    brew install zenity
    brew install dialog

Linux YUM Install:

    yum install -y zenity
    yum install -y dialog

#### Dialog Usage in a Terminal Window session:

### WOL (Wake On Lan) Utilities

WOL (Wake on LAN) Utilities

WOL (Wake on LAN) is a network management feature that is often built into 10/100/1000 Ethernet cards. It allows you to wake up computers on your local subnet that are in a low-power sleeping or "OFF" state.

The WOL protocol works by sending a "magic packet" value to a specific computer's ethernet-based IP address/MAC address. The computer then exits from a dormant low-power state and either wakes up from sleep, or does a cold-boot.

If you are working with high-speed networking gear, often a 10Gb+ Ethernet-based network device will have a separate management port for WOL usage that runs at a slower 10/1000 Ethernet speed.

The "wolcmd" executable is a handy free command-line tool that allows a command prompt or terminal session to perform WOL operations:

[Wolcmd for Windows](https://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/wake-on-lan-cmd)

[Wolcmd for macOS](https://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/wake-on-lan-for-apple-mac)

ZSH/Bash Syntax:

    # An example of using WOL (Wake on LAN)
    echo "[WOL] Waking up R01"

### Finding Your IP Address

Finding Your IP Address

If you don't know the current IP address for your computer you can check in your operating system's "Network" control panel for more details.

#### Mac Network Preferences

Mac Network Preferences

![[img/image132.png]]

On macOS you need to click on the System Preferences icon in your Dock. Then open the Network control panel. On the left side of the Network control panel is a listing of each of the network adapters on your computer with entries for things like WiFi, and Ethernet devices.

Select the network adapter you are currently using to access the internet. This network connection will have a green circle icon next to it. With the network adapter selected, the main part of the control panel displays your local IP address next to the words "IP Address:".

You will also see information about this network adapter at the top of the network view next to the words Status: Connected \[Device\] is currently active and has the IP Address of \[address\].

#### Windows 10 Network Control Panel

Windows 10 Network Control Panel

![[img/image209.png]]

On Windows you need to open the Control Panel \> Network and Internet \> Network Connections window. Right click on your active network connection. Then select the "Status" item in the popup menu.

A status window will open. Click on the Details... button to find out more information about this network device. Then a "Network Connection Details" window will appear. Your current local IP address is listed next to the IPv4 Address line.

#### Linux Network Settings

Linux Network Settings

The easiest way to find out your IP address visually on Linux is to load the Network settings window.

Open the triangle shaped menu at the top right of the screen and select the Settings icon. This will load the "All Settings" window that is used to configure the Linux system.

![[img/image77.png]]

Look in the "All Settings" window for the Hardware section. Then click on the Network icon on the far right side of the window.

![[img/image396.png]]

On the left side of the Network settings window is a listing of each of the network adapters on your computer with entries for things like WiFi, Bluetooth, and Wired Ethernet devices.

Select the network adapter you are currently using to access the internet.

This network connection will probably be called "Wired" on a Linux workstation. With the network adapter selected, the main part of the Network window displays your local IP address next to the words "IPv4 Address".

If you have multiple network adapters on your Linux system the active interface will have the word "Connected" displayed next to in the main part of the Network window to the left of the ON/OFF button.

![[img/image207.png]]

#### Finding your External IP Address Using your Web Browser

Finding your External IP Address Using your Web Browser

A quick and easy way to find out your external ip address is to visit a website like [ipecho.net](https://ipecho.net) or [whatsmyip.org](https://www.whatsmyip.org).

This external IP address is only reachable if your computer is directly connected to the internet and your IP address is not hidden by NAT (Network Address Translation) from your computer existing behind a router or hardware firewall.

If you are behind a router that has NAT enabled then you may have to set up a port forward to route port 80 from your cable modem/router and map it to your computer's manually configured local IP address. This is something that your system administrator or ISP (internet service provider) can assist you with.

#### Finding your External IP Address on Mac and Linux

Finding your External IP Address on Mac and Linux

Your current external internet facing IP address can be also found out on Mac and Linux systems using this terminal command:

    curl ipecho.net/plain; echo

#### ifconfig on Mac and Linux

ifconfig on Mac and Linux

On Mac and Linux systems your local IP address can be found using the ifconfig program from the terminal:

    ifconfig

You have to scroll through the output to look for an "en" network entry like:

    net 192.168.0.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255

#### hostname on Linux

hostname on Linux

On CentOS 7 and RedHat 7 Linux systems your local IP address can often be found using the hostname program from the terminal:

    hostname -i

#### ipconfig on Windows

ipconfig on Windows

On Windows your local IP address can be found using the ipconfig program from the command prompt:

    ipconfig

You have to scroll through the output to look for a network entry like:

    IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.100

#### get-wmiobject on Windows

get-wmiobject on Windows

On Windows you could also use the get-wmiobject program from the command prompt to look up the local IP address:

    powershell -Command "& {get-wmiobject -class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter IPEnabled=true | select ipaddress}"

This command will return the IP Address and network MAC address details in a long string of text like:

    {192.168.0.100, fe80::e5cd:fce8:700d:1b4e, fdb2:2c26:f4e4:0:54d2:4949:9f22:c62b, fdb2:2c26:f4e4:0:e5cd:fce8:700d:1b4e}

The first `192.168.0.100` entry in this block of text is your computer's local network IP address.

## Using Notepad++ for Fusion on Windows

### BBEdit Script Environment Variables

BBEdit Script Environment Variables

A BBEdit shell script is able to access several handy environment variables. This feature lets your external script know things about the current document that is open "`${BB_DOC_PATH}`", and what line is selected in the file "`${BB_DOC_SELSTART_LINE}`".

Here is list of the most common environment variables you can use with BBEdit launched shell scripts:

    ${BB_DOC_LANGUAGE}        Name of the document's current language (not set if language is "none") BB_DOC_MODE            Emacs mode of the document's current language 
    ${BB_DOC_NAME}            name of the document 
    ${BB_DOC_PATH}            path of the document (not set if doc is unsaved) 
    ${BB_DOC_SELEND}          (zero-based) end of the selection range (not set if not text document) 
    ${BB_DOC_SELEND_COLUMN}   (one-based) de-tabbed column number of BB_DOC_SELEND 
    ${BB_DOC_SELEND_LINE}     (one-based) line number of BB_DOC_SELEND 
    ${BB_DOC_SELSTART}        (zero-based) start of the selection range (not set if not text document) 
    ${BB_DOC_SELSTART_COLUMN} (one-based) de-tabbed column number of BB_DOC_SELSTART 
    ${BB_DOC_SELSTART_LINE}   (one-based) line number of BB_DOC_SELSTART

The Reactor Package Manager is used to install the KartaLink collection of tools.

![[img/image70.jpg]]

There are two versions of the Keyboard Maestro macros: A version that can be connected to image based input/output connections, and a version that works with text based input/output connections such as the Vonk Ultra "vText" nodes.

![[img/image134.jpg]]

The"kvrKeyboardMaestro" fuses have an "Open Keyboard Maestro" button that is found in the Inspector window. This feature makes revising the automation macros a single-click task.

![[img/image234.jpg]]

The Keyboard Maestro Editor is very flexible in how you build your automation macros. You can either run a recorder to track your visual on-screen actions, or you can incrementally build the actions one at a time by hand for more precision and control.

![[img/image26.jpg]]

![[img/image47.jpg]]

#### Usage:

Usage:

1\. Create a new comp.

2\. Add a "kvrKeyboardMaestro" image or text based fuse to the comp.

3\. In the Inspector window, enter the name of the Keyboard Maestro macro you want launched into the text field labelled "Macro Name".

4\. The first time the macro is run, you need to approve a macOS security message that says:

    "Fusion.app" wants access to control "Keyboard Maestro.app". Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in "Keyboard Maestro.app" and to perform actions within that app.

You need to click the "OK" button to continue.

5\. In Keyboard Maestro's Editor program create a corresponding macro that will perform the actual GUI automation tasks. Click the "New Action" button in the Editor window to add each step you'd like the macro to carry out. You could also use the "Record" button to save a series of mouse interactions or keyboard button presses.

6\. When your macro is complete, switch out of the "Edit" state and then try out the macro.

#### Tips:

Tips:

If you only want Keyboard Maestro launched when a Fusion batch render is occurring, uncheck the "Interactive Render" checkbox.

### Using AppleScript OSAX Scripting from the Terminal

Using AppleScript OSAX Scripting from the Terminal

AppleScript is the native macOS scripting architecture that allows for inter-application control via the Apple Scripting Dictionary and Apple Events. AppleScripts are typically created in the macOS Script Editor program. You can also run inline AppleScript code as a block of text from a command-prompt session using the OSAX scripting utility.

### KartaLink \| Apple Script Node

KartaLink \| Apple Script Node

Kartaverse's KartaLink tool collection includes a package named "KartaLink \| Apple Script". This is available in the Reactor Package Manager for Resolve/Fusion.

![[img/image39.jpg]]

Run macOS based Apple Script code snippets from inside a Fusion Studio node-graph. This unlocks node-based automation techniques such as controlling external applications via Apple Events and OSAX (Open Scripting Architecture Extension) scripting.

In only a few moments you can start exploring Apple Script automation techniques inside of Resolve/Fusion. The simplest command to begin with if this is 100% new territory for you is "beep" which plays a chime sound as each frame is rendered. The double dashes on the first line of code is used to add a comment entry that is ignored when the code is run.

![[img/image338.jpg]]

Apple Script allows you to automate tasks that can include sending SMS messages via the Apple Messages app.

![[img/image198.jpg]]

It's now possible to have progress messages or other info passed from Resolve/Fusion to your cell phone via SMS when you need to find out what's happening on a rendering task.

![[img/image219.jpg]]

The Apple Script Editor dictionary allows you to learn more about the 3rd party scripting capabilities you can tap into on your mac.

The "Open Dictionary" window allows you to select Apple Scriptable programs and learn more about their capability.

![[img/image124.png]]

This is the Apple Script Dictionary output from the Panic Transmit file transfer program.

![[img/image401.jpg]]

You could also use the "Record" button to save a series of interactions into the Apple Script Editor window.

After you record a task in the Script Editor window, you can then copy/paste this code back into the "kvrAppleScript" fuse's interface in the Resolve/Fusion Inspector view.

### LuaJIT in Resolve/Fusion

LuaJIT in Resolve/Fusion

Blackmagic Design's Resolve Studio, and Fusion Studio software, both include a scripting API known as "FuScript". This scripting system has a built-in copy of the LuaJIT interpreter which allows users to run .lua script files. You can also use your own install of Python with the FuScript API.

LuaJIT has advanced features like "[FFI library](https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html)" access which allows .lua scripts and fuses to access ANSI C API functions provided by external shared libraries like .dll (Windows), .dylib (macOS), and .so (Linux and macOS).

### Lua Rocks Package Manager

Lua Rocks Package Manager

Lua Rocks provides a web-based cross-platform compatible package manager that runs from a Terminal session. This approach is the most common way to be able to find and use compiled Lua modules.

<https://luarocks.org/>

Lua Rock compiled Lua Modules can be used with the LuaJIT FFI interface from Resolve Studio and Fusion Studio.

You may have to customize your macOS Terminal shell session's "LUA_PATH" and "LUA_CPATH" environment variables if you want Fusion to be able to use the Lua Rocks compiled libraries.

Doing this step means you don't have to copy your Lua Rocks compiled .dll/.so files and .lua files into the Fusion managed LuaModules: PathMap folder.

### Accessing the Dall-E API

Accessing the Dall-E API

The OpenAI Dall-E machine learning based image generation toolset is now available to the public using a web-based API. This makes it possible to quickly create concept images from a simple text-based prompt input syntax.

Dall-E Resources

-   [Dall-E Website](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta/)
-   [WSL - Dalle-E API Now Available in Public](https://www.steakunderwater.com/wesuckless/viewtopic.php?p=42833#p42833) (Fusion Community Forum Thread)
-   [LinkedIn \| Using OpenAI DALL·E With the Vonk Data Nodes in Fusion](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-openai-dalle-vonk-data-nodes-fusion-andrew-hazelden/)

A DALL-E demo of the "[Girl with a Pearl Earring](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting/)" painting shows the power of out-painting to extend the canvas larger on an image. In visual effects workflows, this approach would be a big help for digital matte painters who need to extend the border of a frame to provide padding for 2.5D centric pan and tile workflows.

### Using OpenAI DALL·E With the Vonk Data Nodes in Fusion

Using OpenAI DALL·E With the Vonk Data Nodes in Fusion

![[img/image268.png]]

#### Step 1. Account Registry

Step 1. Account Registry

Start by registering for an [OpenAI account](https://openai.com/api/) to get an API Key. This allows you to access Dall-E as a web service. You get \$18 in credits with a new OpenAI account registry.

#### Step 2. API Key

Step 2. API Key

Click at the top right corner of the OpenAI webpage on your account name. Then select the menu entry labelled "View API Keys". On the API keys page select the "Create new secret key" option. This will generate a new API key.

![[img/image387.png]]

After you see the "API key generated" dialog, you will have to save a copy of this code somewhere for later use. This is important as the information is only displayed once in this dialog.

![[img/image247.png]]

On the API Keys view you will see a reduced detail summary of each API key that is active for your account. You can delete old keys by clicking on the trash can icon.

![[img/image324.png]]

#### Step 3. Environment Variable

Step 3. Environment Variable

Create a new environment variable to hold the API key. Our environment variable will be named "`OPENAI_API_KEY`" and the variable will hold the contents of the API Key you created in step 2.

![[img/image291.png]]

#### Step 4. Install Vonk

Step 4. Install Vonk

Install the "Vonk Ultra" atom package for Resolve/Fusion using the WSL Reactor Package Manager. Re-launch Resolve/Fusion once after installing Vonk to activate the new fuses.

#### Step 5. Explore the "Vonk Dall-E" Example Comp

Step 5. Explore the "Vonk Dall-E" Example Comp

Open the provided "`Demo Vonk Dall-E.comp`" example project in Fusion Studio.

![[img/image218.png]]

This example comp uses the sample image generation prompt text of "Blackmagic Design Control Panel, Fusion Reactor, Cooling Tank, Blue Glow Water".

Note: Performance optimizations for this example comp can be implemented in the future that will reduce unneeded Fusion pre-process requests. These are what cause re-downloads of the cURL JSON file to occur on the same frame. As usual, down the road all of this can be wrapped into a single neat-and-tidy fuse node that does all of the processing steps internally. :)

#### Common JSON Errors

Common JSON Errors

If an error occurs while generating the image, the technical information about the issue will be written into the JSON file. This allows you to troubleshoot problems and track down the source of the problem.

If you have a valid OpenAI API Key the most common JSON error for a free usage account will be:

    {
      "error": {
        "code": null,
        "message": "Rate limit reached for images per minute. Limit: 25/5min. Current: 27/5min. Please visit https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6696591 to learn how to increase your rate limit.",
        "param": null,
        "type": "requests"
      }
    }

If you do not have a valid API key then you will see a JSON error of:

    {
        "error": {
            "message": "Incorrect API key provided: YOUR_API_KEY. You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com.",
            "type": "invalid_request_error",
            "param": null,
            "code": "invalid_api_key"
        }
    }

If you don't have anything typed into the prompt text-field (meaning the text field content is completely empty) you will see a JSON error of:

    {
        "error": {
        "code": null,
        "message": "You must provide a prompt.",
        "param": null,
        "type": "invalid_request_error"
      }
    }

If Dall-E could not understand the meaning of your prompt you will see a JSON error of:

    {  "error": {
        "code": null,
        "message": "Something went wrong with your generation. You may try again or ask for a different prompt",
        "param": null,
        "type": "server_error"
      }
    }

If you hit into the Dall-E safety-rule limitations it means your prompt words are being censored. In those cases you will see an error like this message which was generated by having the words "COVID mask" as part of a prompt:

    {
      "error": {
        "code": null,
        "message": "Your request was rejected as a result of our safety system. Your prompt may contain text that is not allowed by our safety system.",
        "param": null,
        "type": "invalid_request_error"
      }
    }

#### Windows Command Prompt Test

Windows Command Prompt Test

If you want to do a test run of the cURL + OpenAI Key environment variable you can try running this cURL code directly in a command-prompt window:

    "curl.exe" -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer %OPENAI_API_KEY%" -d "{\"prompt\": \"Blackmagic Design Control Panel, Fusion Reactor, Cooling Tank, Blue Glow Water\", \"n\": 1, \"size\": \"256x256\"}"  https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations

The JSON based request result you will get back looks like this:

    {
      "created": 1667534341,
      "data": [
        {
          "url": "https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/<snip>.png?st=2022-11-04T02%3A59%3A01Z&se=2022-11-04T04%3A59%3A01Z&sp=r&sv=2021-08-06&sr=b&rscd=inline&rsct=image/png&skoid=<snip>&skt=2022-11-04T00%3A59%3A13Z&ske=2022-11-05T00%3A59%3A13Z&sks=b&skv=2021-08-06&sig=<snip>"
        }
      ]
    }

When you copy the URL part of the text output from the command prompt window session into your Web browser's address bar, you will then see a new randomly created PNG image. With any luck it will look like something out of a futuristic SciFi movie with moody blue lighting in the results:

![[img/image19.png]]![[img/image66.png]]

#### Comp Description (Download from the WSL Dall-E Thread)

Comp Description (Download from the WSL Dall-E Thread)

The command line version of cURL is used to perform a JSON request with an authorization token. You need to have an OpenAI API Key stored in an environment variable named "`OPENAI_API_KEY`".

The ML image generator prompt is defined in the "ImagePrompt" node. The number of images generated each time is defined in the "ImageCount" node. The image size for the generated imagery is a square image sized to either 256px, 512px, or 1024px. This value is defined in the "ImageSizePx" node.

The "vTextSubFormatMultiline" node is used to combine the command-line launching string elements together using several text based input connections. Each input on the node matches a token value like input #1 = {1}, input #2 = {2}, Input #3 = \[3}, etc...

The vTextProcessOpen node runs a shell command via popen(). This is how we launch the command line version of cURL to request that OpenAI generates a new image. BTW Windows 10 & 11 include cURL with the OS by default. The vTextViewer node makes it easier to read the shell commands that will be run in the Inspector view.

A temporary .bat/.sh/.command file is written to disk. This holds the current cURL CLI command needed. Doing this avoids one whole level of headaches for the handling of nested quotation symbols in blocks of text used by "`popen()`".

The vTextSubFormat2 node named "LinkOrder" uses the 1st input connection to replace the data stream from the vTextProcessOpen node with the original filename of the JSON file. This keeps the order of processing inline when rendering the comp.

The "vJSONFromFile1" node reads in the JSON data using the supplied filename. The JSON data downloaded by cURL is then loaded into a ScriptVal based Lua table. The "data.#.url" table element is accessed nodally to extract a URL that points to a specific element index number's PNG image resource.

The PNG image is then displayed in Fusion using a "vImageFromNet" node.

Finally, a grid of image views are combined into a single horizontal frame layout using the "vImageCreateTiles" node.

The "Tiles X" parameter on this node is driven based upon the number of elements in the ScriptVal Lua table. This allows the "ImageCount" node to automatically adjust the number of images loaded into the grid view.

#### Rescuing Your vImageFromNet Temp Files

Rescuing Your vImageFromNet Temp Files

The "vImageFromNet" node caches a temporary file to disk for each download request that is processed. The cache location is the "Temp:/Vonk/" PathMap folder which is a directory that is automatically cleared by your operating system on restart.

This is a relevant tip if your latest interactive prompt creation and rendering session resulted in an amazing image being generated... that you are then having a hard time recreating later on. In this type of circumstance you may need to "fish out" that specific asset from the Dall-E processed temporary PNG image files in the cache directory.

If this is the case, you can quickly access this content using the "Script \> Vonk Ultra \> Open \> Show Temp Folder" menu item.

![[img/image304.png]]

### Dall-E for Fusion

Dall-E for Fusion

There is now a macro packaged version of the "Dall-E for Fusion" workflow. It bundles all of the Vonk nodes into a single GroupOperator that is streamlined with a minimalistic UI for artists to interact with.

Under the hood this macro uses the Base64 request format option to communicate with the Dall-E API's web service. This requires you to have the most recent version of Vonk Ultra (with the Base64 atom package) installed. :)

![[img/image258.png]]

The "Image Resolution" control defines how large of an image is created. You can choose between "256px", "512px", or "1024px". This will generate either a "256x256 px", "512x512 px", or "1024x1024 px" sized image.

The "Number of Images" control specifies how many images are generated at a single time. These images are then accessible by advancing the Fusion timeline play head frame-by-frame.

The "Prompt" text field is where you enter your text to define what type of image content you want to have generated by Dall-E. Do not use quote symbols in this text-field. When entering text into the prompt, keep the content as a "single line" block of text without adding any newline characters, slashes or quote characters.

The "Show Temp Folder" button allows you to open the "`Temp:/Vonk/Dall-E/`" PathMap location on-disk. You can browse the cached images saved here if you need to recover a previously generated image.

#### Example Comp and Macro (Download from the WSL Dall-E Thread)

Example Comp and Macro (Download from the WSL Dall-E Thread)

![[img/image183.png]]

Description

This comp allows you to use the OpenAI "Dall-E" image generator.

In order to use the "`kdrDallE`" macro you need to have the "Vonk Ultra" package installed from Reactor. You also need to register for an OpenAI API key to access the Dall-E API via the web. This API key should be added to an environment variable on your computer named "`OPENAI_API_KEY`".

Note

I'm still refining the image caching functionality in the macro, especially when the Number of Images control is above 1.

For the next update I need to learn more from Dall-E's API docs on what their equivalent to a seed value is to see how stable of an output you can get within a short window of time with the exact same prompt request.

### Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is an open-source machine learning based "AI" image generator created by [StabilityAI](https://stability.ai/). There is a web-based "DreamStudio" interface that can be explored. It is quite similar to MidjourneyAI and OpenAI's Dall-E technology.

For getting started quickly, Stable Diffusion's "DreamStudio" is an easy-to-use interface for creating images using the recently released Stable Diffusion image generation model. Stable Diffusion is a fast, efficient model for creating images from text which understands the relationships between words and images. It can create high quality images of anything you can imagine in seconds--just type in a text prompt and hit Dream. A safety filter is activated by default.

Already there is a [Photoshop](https://christiancantrell.com/#ai-ml) plugin, several [Blender](https://github.com/carson-katri/dream-textures) plugins, a [Figma](https://twitter.com/RemitNotPaucity/status/1571295016869568513) plugin, and a [Krita](https://github.com/sddebz/stable-diffusion-krita-plugin) plugin.

### Imagemagick

Imagemagick

Imagemagick is a popular command-line image editing and conversion utility that is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows. In addition to the command-line based tools, there are versions of Imagemagick that can be used from inside scripting languages, or as a dynamic library that can be accessed from compiled programming languages.

<https://imagemagick.org/>

Using Imagemagick to Burn in Text Overlays

Here is an Imagemagick shell scripting example that creates a desktop wallpaper image that has a text caption rendered from a text file named "desktop_caption.txt". The output is saved to an image named "Desktop.png":

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # Desktop Pattern Generator

    echo "Desktop Pattern Generator"

    HOST='R01'
    IPADDRESS='10.20.30.1'
    MACADDRESS='00:25:90:59:5b:16'
    NETSPEED='1000T'
    HARDDISK='70 GB HD / 34 GB Free'
    OSVERSION='Ubuntu 14.04.05 LTS'

    # Generate a text string and write it to disk
    printf "${HOST} / ${IPADDRESS}\n${MACADDRESS} ${NETSPEED}\n${HARDDISK}\n${OSVERSION}"> $TMPDIR/desktop_caption.txt

    # Create the rendered image from the text file

### EXIFTOOL

EXIFTOOL

The exiftool command-line utility is used to modify EXIF metadata tags in images. This tool allows a terminal (Linux/macOS) or command-prompt (Windows) based shell script to carry out batch operations of reading/writing/editing image metadata on a folder of images.

<https://exiftool.org/>

When you start writing your own pipeline tools for automating volumetric video or ML workflows, it can be useful to take the time to embed meaningful EXIF metadata into each of the images used in a project folder.

This is especially relevant if you are working with multi-view content, or need to convert dozens of movies into image sequences and want to add information into each file. The thing to remember with metadata is that when you do things correctly, those records will be passed down-stream to all the other tools in the pipeline, in a seamless manner.

### Hugin Nona

### PCoIP Thin Clients

PCoIP Thin Clients

Remote workers in the enterprise end of the media sector often use thin client systems driven by "PCoIP" hardware like HP branded Teradici remote access terminals.

<https://www.teradici.com>

This thin client gear passes USB (keyboard, mouse, graphics tablet), sound, and monitor signals in an encrypted fashion over a conventional high-speed internet connection. The remote employee never has access to raw files over this thin client connection and only sees the visual image on the monitor which makes studios happy for security reasons.

On the data center side of things, the host server system for the thin client session provides hardware accelerated graphics using NVIDIA GRID GPU drivers. Often the system provides more than 4 concurrent user sessions per rack-mounted server case.

### Workstation Reference Hardware

Workstation Reference Hardware

The average visual workstation in the enterprise end of the Film & TV / immersive sector has a NVIDIA CUDA graphics card with an RTX 2000/3000 series GPU hardware for freelancers, and NVIDIA A6000 or newer series GPUs for 3D animators, and game artists inside of large corporate studio settings.

Most workstations have a small dedicated SSD/NVME drive for the OS boot volume.

Then the artists' programs are run from a shared file server. It is worth mentioning that temp files generated by programs are not commonly written to the boot volume. All user data is read/written from a 10 Gig Ethernet connected network file path that is specific to the current show they are working on.

A separate dedicated computer (that is not the file server) is used as a license server for all of the workstations on a local area network. This license server system will have all the required hardware license dongles attached to it, and floating software licenses are bound to that system's unique hardware IDs as well.

These days some studios require/expect to have the ability to run a license server on a VMWARE vSphere based virtual machine, or on an Amazon AWS EC2 cloud hosted instance. For companies that are going for fully cloud-based workstations, "login based" licensing is common.

### Dummy HDMI Plugs for Headless GPU Render Nodes

Dummy HDMI Plugs for Headless GPU Render Nodes

When setting up headless render nodes that need to run 24x7 with hardware accelerated GPU rendering tasks it is important to plug a "dummy HDMI plug" dongle-like device into the GPU. These are readily available from marketplaces like OWC, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dummy+plug), eBay.

This allows the graphics card to correctly auto-sense the EDID resolution parameters so macOS, Windows, and Linux window managers operate correctly. It also allows screen sharing programs to work more reliably.

Some remote access programs, like Parsec, also benefit from having a spare mouse plugged into the USB port if you want to have a hardware cursor that works on Windows.

### PCIe Riser Ribbon Cables

PCIe Riser Ribbon Cables

If you need to get creative with how you build your workstation to be able to fit in multiple GPUs a less common option is to use LinkUP brand PCIe flex cables. Amazon is a good source for them when they are available.

<https://linkup.one/ultra-4-0-pcie-riser-cables/>

The flex cables come in up to 30 cm long lengths while still being able to function on a PCIe Gen 4 bus at 16 lanes of bandwidth. It is possible to "fan out" several large GPUs like NVIDIA RTX 3090s in a wider fashion than the mechanical limits of PCIe motherboard slot spacing with LinkUP cables.

![[img/image2.jpg]]

![[img/image109.jpg]]

Note: The "LinkUP flex cables" shown above are not bandwidth-throttled like the commonly available discount cables on Amazon or eBay that come from the more common "cryptocurrency mining" style of single-lane PCIe cables and risers. Discount cables must be avoided at all costs as this format of hardware is not effective for GPU rendering use.

### IPMI Remote Management Interface

IPMI Remote Management Interface

If you are building a render farm with second-hand "surplus" business and industrial server gear purchased from eBay, you might notice the presence on server systems from vendors like Super-Micro of a low-level device management interface that was known as an IPMI interface.

This interface allows you to modify BIOS settings remotely via a dedicated ethernet IP network connection that is separate from the server's network interface used by the running operating system.

If the server is an older generation like a quad AMD G34 CPU powered system, you may have to run the IPMI management utility in a virtual machine that runs an older release of Windows ranging from Windows XP, Vista, or 7. This was due to using the common requirement of Internet Explorer 6 and ActiveX controls.

### NVME Storage Raid Controller Cards

NVME Storage Raid Controller Cards

KartaVR v5's volumetric workflows were developed using a file server that had a High-Point SSD7540 8x NVME raid array controller card. The card is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS systems which is excellent.

The disk throughput is quite phenomenal and it reduces the pain of working with large media assets like tons of image sequences and per-frame photogrammetry reconstructed mesh sequences.

### VR/HMD Based Haptic Interfaces

VR/HMD Based Haptic Interfaces

An interesting consideration when re-creating virtual environments, is the existing Meta Quest HMD supports [optical hand-tracking](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/controllers-and-hand-tracking/hand-tracking-quest-2). Hand tracking brings accurate real-time "hand gesture" capture into a virtual world.

Hand-tracking works without the need for any 3rd party plastic VR hand-controller gadgets/nunchucks. One simply reaches out and uses one's own fingers to interact directly with objects existing inside the digital-twin location.

You can touch, pick up, carry and interact with the props, tools, and natural objects in the virtual environment. Forces like gravity act upon the objects so dropping or setting down a prop will kick-off a rigid body dynamics simulation of the settling motion as the object's motion comes to a resting state.

These images show the Meta Quest HMD's hand gesture training content:

## Installing Hardware Virtualization Tools

Installing Hardware Virtualization Tools

If you need to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware you have multiple approaches that can be taken to solve this task. Virtualization is the creation of a "canister" like container that represents something that could be best described as a unique imaginary computer device that is simulated inside your active computer session. Each processor instruction call done inside the virtual machine is injected back into the real CPU processor using an approach called a hypervisor.

This approach allows you to use disk images to store the operating system and files. The virtual machine can support input devices, USB, audio, monitor connections, remote screen sharing, networking with controllable data routing options. A unique ethernet MAC ID address is assigned for each virtual machine network interface.

The virtual machine is able to be snapshotted, paused, resumed, reset, and shutdown as needed. The virtual machine session can be hosted locally or in the cloud, and it is even possible to transfer the location of a running virtual machine session between different data centers while it is still running.

One essential feature when working with graphics programs on a virtual machine instance is the support for native graphics rendering calls to the underlying hardware. This is called PCIe hardware passthrough support. It allows a virtualization environment to access native OpenGL, DirectX, OpenCL, CUDA, and Metal features that are able to work at peak performance often with less than 1-3% of a non-virtualized process running on the same hardware.

VirtualBox has a shared clipboard copy/paste feature that helps make the process of using Windows applications like web browsers and text editors seamless inside a Linux host OS based environment.

At the top of the VirtualBox window, select the "**Devices \> Shared Clipboard \> Bidirectional**" menu item. This turns on two way copying between Linux and Windows.

![[img/image3.png]]

You can also access this bidirectional clipboard option using the "**Win10 Settings \> General \> Advanced**" tab. In this view, you can set the "**Shared Clipboard:**" to "**Bidirectional**". Set the "**Drag 'n Drop:**" control to "**Bidirectional**" as well.

#### VirtualBox Shared Folders

VirtualBox Shared Folders

When you are working with Linux and Windows filesystems on the same host computer, it can be a big help to be able to pass files transparently between the two operating systems.

VirtualBox offers a "Shared Folder" option inside each virtual machine environment. You are able to choose the source folder on the host OS side, and the mount location inside the virtual machine where that content shows up.

It is also possible to decide if you want that shared folder location to be read-only which is useful in some cases if you don't want to have security risks like data being modified inside a Windows virtual machine used for software testing.

**Step 1.** Turn off the Windows session using the Windows 10 start menu "**Shutdown**" feature.

**Step 2.** In the VirtualBox software, where a "**VirtualBox Manager**" dialog shows all of the virtual machines, click on the left sidebar entry for "Win10". Then click in the toolbar on the orange colored "**Settings**" gearwheel icon.

![[img/image226.png]]

**Step 3.** This will open up the VirtualBox Settings dialog for that specific virtual machine session. On the left sidebar of this "**Win10 - Settings**" dialog, select the "**Shared Folder**" entry. Then click on the far top right corner of the Shared Folder's view on a small icon that shows a "**folder with + sign**" icon. This is the button used to add a new Linux to Windows shared folder location.

![[img/image91.png]]

**Step 4.** An "Add Share" dialog will appear. This is where you set up the folder sharing settings.

Click on the "**Folder Path**" pop-up menu, and choose the "**Other...**" option. Navigate to select your Linux home folder path which equates to "**\$HOME**".

![[img/image84.png]]

In the "Add Share" dialog, set the values to something roughly like this:

**Folder Path:** `\home\vfx`

**Folder Name:** `vfx`

\[x\] **Auto-mount** (enable the checkbox)

**Mount Point:** `F:\`

**Step 5.** Then click the "**OK**" button to close this dialog. Back in the "Win10 - Settings" dialog, also click the "**OK**" button to close this dialog.

Step 6. Now you should be back in the "VirtualBox Manager" Window. Click on the Win10 virtual machine. Then press down in the center of the green "Start" button. This will re-launch the Windows 10 session.

![[img/image133.png]]

#### VirtualBox Display Settings

VirtualBox Display Settings

VirtualBox supports a wide range of GPU customizations that will increase the performance of the virtualized graphics. In the default compatibility mode we will use the "**Graphics Controller**" option of "**VBoxSVGA**".

In the "**Acceleration:**" section turn on the "**\[x\] Enable 3D Acceleration**" checkbox.

Drag the "**Video Memory:**" slider all the way to the right to select all the video memory we can allocate. This is typically "**256 MB**".

#### VirtualBox Audio Settings

#### Windows Start Menu Based Startup Folders

Windows Start Menu Based Startup Folders

A startup folder based approach is handy if you need to launch a program or command-line script when Windows starts. This is a viable option you might consider using in cases where a system service is not possible such as for tasks that require GPU based hardware acceleration.

The two most often used Windows startup folder locations are:

    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\


    C:\Users\vfx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\

### Install Rocky Linux 8.5 on a Bare Metal System

Install Rocky Linux 8.5 on a Bare Metal System

This part of the guide is here to help if you have an emergency on one of your computer systems and fixing the issue requires you to fully reload the operating system. This process can be scary the first few times you do it, especially if one has never performed a fresh install of Rocky Linux on a visual workstation or render node system.

In your BIOS settings, make sure USB based media is bootable. The USB boot media needs to be listed at the top of the "Boot Priority" dialog, in advance of the internal hard disk in the list. This allows the computer to start up using the external USB boot media as the primary operating system during the install process.

#### Installation Summary

Installation Summary

The installation summary dialog lets you fully customize the Rocky Linux 8 OS installation parameters.

Note: There is a certain order-of-operations logic needed, where you have to define the network properties in advance, if you want to use any internet connected features in the other parts of the installer.

![[img/image400.png]]

#### System

System

KDUMP

Rocky Linux has a diagnostics mode called "KDUMP" that can save diagnostic logging information when a crash occurs. For most normal use cases in the VFX and animation sector, like setting up a new render node or a workstation, this KDUMP feature is not required.

Let's disable KDUMP and get 160 MB of extra RAM back in the process. Uncheck the "\[ \] Enable kdump" checkbox near the top left of this dialog window. Then press the "Done" button to return to the primary "Installation Summary" installer screen.

![[img/image167.png]]

#### Network & Host Name

Network & Host Name

The "Network & Host Name" dialog allows you to bring network interfaces like WiFi connections or Ethernet connections online. This means you can use Rocky Linux Minimal installation media to get the install going, and pull in the remaining packages you might need over the internet from a repository to complete the set up of a visual workstation.

Select your network interface at the top left part of the dialog. In my case I am using an Etherent connection called "Ethernet (enp0s3)". On the far right side of the dialog is an ON/OFF control. To bring the network interface online, toggle the control to the ON state.

The computer's name is defined with the "Host Name:" field at the bottom left corner of a dialog. I will give this system a host name of "R1" to represent render node 1 in my mini on-premise render cluster. Click the "Apply" button after entering a custom host name.

![[img/image54.png]]

Let's further customize the remaining network settings. Click the "Configure" button.

Network & Host Name \> Configure \> Ethernet \> MTU \> 9000 (This setting will turn on Jumbo packets)

#### Reclaim Disk Space

Reclaim Disk Space

One has to be very careful when you go to remove pre-existing disk partitions on your destination drive where you are installing Rocky Linux. If you have several additional disks in the system, you need to check the drive make/model and disk capacity to ensure you are targeting the correct drive on the install.

The "sdb" like values hop around a bit when you plug in more internal and external drives so stay very vigilant not to destroy important disks like backup drives at this time.

#### Hard Drive Layout

#### Manual Partitioning

Manual Partitioning

New mount points will use the following partitioning scheme:

Standard Partitioning

Note: When you look through the hard drives shown in the "Unknown" section of the dialog, keep an eye out for any volumes that have an "ISO 9660" file system.

Seeing a USB drive listed as "ISO 9660" at this stage typically indicates this volume is the installation media you booted from that was created from an original ISO disk image. Don't delete this drive, as you are likely running the current Rocky Linux OS installer off that disk/memory card/USB thumbdrive right now!!!

#### Create a Disk Partition "One"

Create a Disk Partition "One"

Tip: Look at the top right of the manual partitioning window at the entry labelled "Device(s)" to see the hardware brand and drive model information for the partition you are interacting with.

This will be a value like "ATA OWC Mercury Extr..." for a render node with an SSD drive. Other drives will be listed here for laptops, desktops, or server systems.

To add a new partition to the boot volume click the bottom left of the manual portioning window's little "+" shaped button icon.

#### Add a new mount point dialog

Click the "Add a mount point" button to close the window and apply the settings.

Once the "Add a new mount point" dialog closes and you are back at the "Manual Partitioning" window, you need to click on the "/" based drive partition at the top left part of the window.

Change the "File System" parameter from the default value of "xfs" over to the more flexible option of "ext4". An ext4 based file system can be resized later on once the Linux OS is installed using a partition editing tool like "gparted".

Note: If your hard disk was prepared with the default Linux setting using an "xfs" partition, it can make the relatively basic task of resizing an internal disk partition smaller, a real challenge later on.

##### Troubleshooting Linux GPU Driver Issues

Troubleshooting Linux GPU Driver Issues

Question: Did the GPU setup get fully borked after the NVIDIA GPU Driver install?

If the NVIDIA driver install has issues, one can change the "Run Level" to a text console input mode to help with the recovery process using:

-   To switch the display over to a "Run Level 5" textual console view press the "Control + Alt + F5" keyboard hotkey.

-   To switch the display over to a "Run Level 6" graphical GNOME view press the "Control + Alt + F6" keyboard hotkey.

    \# Switch from a terminal session back to a gnome desktop session startx

##### NVIDIA Preferences

NVIDIA Preferences

After the GPU Drivers are installed you get access to "`nvidia-smi`" and "`nvidia-settings`" as command-line tools:

    # Check the GPU hardware stats from the terminal
    sudo nvidia-smi

![[img/image120.jpg]]

    # Adjust the proprietary NVIDIA GPU driver and display properties
    sudo nvidia-settings

![[img/image193.jpg]]

##### X11 / XORG Graphics Preferences

X11 / XORG Graphics Preferences

When running the "nvidia-settings" program, you should save the edited xorg settings back to disk at the following file path: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"

    # Create a backup of the current xorg file
    sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak

    # Verify the XORG preference file was backed up successfully
    sudo ls -laX /etc/X11/xorg*

#### Installing Linux Software

##### Privacy Settings \| Screen Lock

Privacy Settings \| Screen Lock

If you are in a shared office like working environment it can be useful to have the "Privacy" setting for "Screen Lock" enabled.

![[img/image56.png]]

You can fully customize the Screen Lock features timer value using the "Lock screen after blank for X minutes" control.

Screen Lock OFF

It's possible to select a very permissive value of Screen Lock "OFF" which could possibly be of use in a work-from-home based "home office" environment if you are doing XPU based GPU rendering and have physical access security for the workstations or render nodes.

![[img/image82.png]]

Screen Lock ON

If you are in a co-working space or traditional VFX Studio or a Design Boutique like shared office environment, you might go for a Screen Lock value of somewhere between 5 minutes to 30 minutes.

![[img/image24.png]]

##### Details \> Users Settings \| Automatic Login

Details \> Users Settings \| Automatic Login

If your XPU based render nodes are running in a locked "limited physical access" secured location, or a home-office environment, you might find some workflow benefits from enabling "Automatic Login".

This is relevant if some of your GPU rendering and image-based-modeling tools don't work particularly well when launched via a headless system service approach.

Needless to say, if you are in a large office-like environment with many people present, this is not a viable approach to even think about... 🤪

Once again, if your computer gear is in a limited access location then you might consider the following approach as possibly relevant to your pipeline needs:

Open the Rocky Linux "Settings \> Details \> Users" view.

Then unlock the panel and turn on "Automatic Login".

    # Change the host name in Centos 7:
    sudo gedit /etc/hostname

    # You can also update the host name using:
    sudo gedit /etc/sysconfig/network

    # Look in the text file for the entry: 
    localhost.localdomain

    # Change this line to edit the host name value to something like:
    R1

    # Print the current host name:
    echo The current host name is: uname -n

    # Edit the hosts file:
    sudo gedit /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1 R1 localhost
    ::1       R1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

Log back into your user account.

#### Install the NVIDIA Drivers for CentOS Linux

Install the NVIDIA Drivers for CentOS Linux

NVIDIA RTX 3090 Linux CentOS Driver webpage:

<https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/172376/en-us>

    # Direct Driver Download Link:
    cd $HOME
    wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/460.73.01/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run

    # The Nvidia drivers must be installed while the xorg server is stopped. Switch to text mode, or run this via ssh:

    systemctl isolate multi-user.target

    # Alternatively you can terminate the xserver session which is the hard core route

    sudo killall /usr/bin/X

    # You can start linux in a text console using the Control + Alt + F2 hotkey after you have logged out of the user session

    # Install the drivers (the name of the executable would have to line up with the exact driver version you downloaded)

    cd $HOME
    sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run

    The NVIDIA installer options you want to select are:

    DMKS (yes)

    The NVIDIA installer asks if you want to install 32 bit libraries (yes)

    The NVIDIA installer asks about libglvnd (install and overwrite existing)

    The NVIDIA installer asks about auto update X configuration file? (yes)


    If you are running the default Nouveau graphics drivers on CentOS when you run the NVIDIA installer, you will likely see a message that says:

    ERROR: The Nouveau kernel driver is currently in use by your system.  This driver is incompatible with the NVIDIA driver, and must be disabled before proceeding. Please consult the NVIDIA driver README and your Linux distribution's documentation for details on how to correctly disable the Nouveau kernel driver.

    # You can then disable nouveau driver by changing the configuration "/etc/default/grub" file. Add the entry "nouveau.modeset=0" to the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. 

    sudo nano /etc/default/grub

    # Below you can find example of grub configuration file reflecting the previously suggested change: 

    GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
    GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
    GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
    GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rhgb quiet nouveau.modeset=0"
    GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"

    # You can optionally remove the "quiet" entry on "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" to be able to see startup messages for issues like missing drive automounts.

    # The GRUB changes ensure that the open-source nouveau graphics driver is disabled the next time you boot your CentOS 7 Linux system. Once ready execute the following command to apply the new GRUB configuration change: 

    # If you are running a legacy BIOS system:
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    # If you are running an EFI based system:
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg

    # Reboot your CentOS 7 Linux System.
    sudo reboot

    # Once the boot is finished confirm that the nouveau open-source graphics driver is no longer in use:

    lshw -numeric -C display

#### Green With Envy GPU Utility

Green With Envy GPU Utility

The "Green with Envy" utility can be used to help control the GPU fan speed, and the memory/core timing. This will ensure you get reliable performance when GPU rendering.

This utility works best in systems with only a single NVIDIA GPU installed. The Cinnamon window manager can sometimes freak out with Linux "kernel panic" system lockups if you have multiple GPUs active.

    # Toggle the prefs for all GPUs connected:
    sudo nvidia-xconfig --enable-all-gpus

#### Gnome Settings

Gnome Settings

-   Disable Screensaver
-   Enable Automatic Login

#### Gnome Hotkeys

Gnome Hotkeys

To allow the Autodesk Maya user interface to function correctly, we need to unbind the ALT key in GNOME. This makes it possible to move windows and interact with views in a consistent fashion.

Open the "System Settings \> Window \> Behaviour" tab. Change the "special key to move and resize windows" setting so it is disabled.

It is handy to add a "Control + Alt + t" shortcut that will display a new terminal window.

Go to "System Settings \> keyboard \> Shortcuts tab \> Custom Shortcuts"

Click on the "+" button.

    Name: Terminal Shortcut
    Command: gnome-terminal

Now a new shortcut is added with status "disabled". Click on the "disabled" word and assign your shortcut.

I prefer "Control + Alt + t" to run Terminal but you can customize this hotkey binding to meet your needs.

#### Common Linux Utilities

Common Linux Utilities

At this point you could add several extra Linux utilities.

    # As a quick tip, this is how you install an RPM package file via the terminal window:
    sudo rpm -ivh example.rpm

### Rescuezilla Bare Metal Disk Imaging, Backups and Restores

Rescuezilla Bare Metal Disk Imaging, Backups and Restores

Install Rescuezilla

**Step 1.** Go to the [Rescuezilla](https://rescuezilla.com/download) download page, and download the "`rescuezilla-2.3.1-64bit.impish.iso`" file to disk.

**Step 2.** Download and Install [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), or a similar disk image recording tool.

**Step 3**. Use Balena Etcher to record the "`rescuezilla-2.3.1-64bit.impish.iso`" to an external USB thumbstick or memory card.

Disk to Disk Clone

A 500gb NVME can be copied disk to disk in 5 minutes with [Rescuezilla](https://rescuezilla.com). This tool is a GUI and mouse driven version of the earlier text console based [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php) bootable disk management and backup utility.

Boot windows once and then choose restart to switch over to rescuezilla. This removes the windows hibernation file.

In gparted, if a small partition is spaced out at the far end of the disk you need to use the "move partition" function to bring the selected disk partition inwards, towards the left of the active disk partitions, to be able to fully shrink down a large ext4 or NTFS formatted NVME's storage space usage. This allows you to clone the data onto a smaller hard disk.

You can't resize a partition larger if the "free space" zone is sandwiched on the opposite side of another partition block. In that case, you can slide/move the partition you don't need to make larger, out of the way, to the far right end of a disk.

Rescuezilla Workflow Essentials

-   Move the server to a workbench.
-   Insert the Rescuezilla USB thumbdrive media.
-   Turn on the render node.
-   Press F11 to switch the OS selection over to boot Windows. Restart immediately to Linux Rescuezilla so there is no hibernation image
-   Press F11 at boot to switch the boot OS to Rescuezilla.
-   Select "English" language
-   Select "Graphical Fallback Mode"
-   Using gparted, move the blocking partitions out of the way, then resize the data partitions smaller to fit on a smaller drive.
-   Rescuezilla - clone big disk to smaller disk
-   Using gparted, expand the data partition on cloned drive
-   Shutdown the render node and remove the large NVME, and the Rescuezilla USB thumbdrive media.
-   Turn on the render node
-   Press delete at BIOS and set the boot volume to the 500 GB NVME system.
-   Wait 1 minute from power on for the 10G ethernet to power up and for the OS to finish booting.
-   Restart Windows once to check everything is working as expected.
-   Power off the server and insert the HDMI dummy video adapter dongle.
-   Redeploy the server back to regular operations in the rack.

### Linux BootRepair Utility

Linux BootRepair Utility

If you have issues after installing, upgrading, or cloning a BIOS or UEFI based Linux GRUB bootloader setup you might need to use the BootRepair utility to help fix broken Linux boot configurations. It is available in most Linux Software Manager utilities.

Yes, it is also possible to carry out the same commands fully from a terminal session, but sometimes late in the night between midnight to 2 AM when GRUB most often fails on you, it might be nice to have a Live Image of a Linux distro on a USB thumbdrive along with a Boot-Repair GUI available to try and fix things.

### Installing the Canister LTO Backup Tool

Installing the Canister LTO Backup Tool

Hedge Canister is a macOS based LTO tape backup program that makes creating long-term offline backups easy and reliable. It works with SAS + Thunderbolt connected tape drives on macOS Intel and ARM64 compatible systems.

<https://hedge.video/canister>

![[img/image123.png]]

This is what a typical LTO SAS tape drive looks like. This unit is an HP Enterprise Ultrium drive in an external enclosure. It has SAS connectors on the back that are used to connect to a file server.

![[img/image346.jpg]]

When choosing hardware, it is handy to know that Apple macMini systems make a very affordable macOS based host for an LTO drive. You will want to add 10Gb Ethernet to the macMini via a Thunderbolt solution if the computer doesn't natively have 10Gb Ethernet onboard.

If you need to connect a SAS based LTO tape drive to a macOS based host system you can use an OWC Mercury Helios 3 Thunderbolt 3 PCIe enclosure to host an ATTO SAS based PCIe card. It takes a bit of research to gather all the required cabling and SAS adapters if you haven't used gear with the SAS protocol before.

![[img/image5.jpg]]

LTO Tapes have a long archival shelf-life if stored according to manufacturer's instructions in the proper environmental conditions. LTO tapes are typically ordered in box sizes of 5-tape cartridges at a time.
