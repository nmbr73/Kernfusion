# Kernfusion

Tach, not much in here - until now this repo is more my own note taking place / scratch pad kind of thing ... yada yada ... whatever ... you may (or may not) want to look into ...

- [Fusion/](Fusion/README.md) ... Fuses, Macros, Comps - pretty empty and not working yet
- [Wiki/](https://nmbr73.github.io/Kernfusion/) ... not a wiki and in the making

... whatever


To get started checkout the repository and then open `Wiki/` as an Obsidian.md vault.

### Folders

- **[`Wiki/`](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Wiki)** ... main place to document stuff; organized as an Obsidian vault; used source to create the `docs/`
- **`docs/`** ... a temporary folder; target for the [static website](https://nmbr73.github.io/Kernfusion/) content generated out of the files under [`Wiki/`](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Wiki) via [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
- **[`Fusion/`](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Fusion)** ... Comps, Fuses, Macros for use in Fusion - when creating the `docs/` the whole folder is copied into it as [`docs/Kernfusion`](https://nmbr73.github.io/Kernfusion/Kernfusion/) to make its content available / navigable in the documentation
- **[`Data/`](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Data)** ... resources (textures and such) used in the example compositions under [Fusion/Comp/](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/Fusion/Comp)
- **[`supplements/mkdocs/`](https://github.com/nmbr73/Kernfusion/tree/main/supplements)** ...
- **`venv`** ... local folder (not version controlled) for a virtual Python environment (i.e. to install mkdocs into a virtual, but not your system wide environment)
